    0x00F1, // But now, in late winter, it feels like I'm standing under a pile of kindling.
    0x013F, // I breathe into my cupped hands and rub them together furiously to prevent them from numbing in this cold.
    0x01A9, // Just how long am I expected to wait out here, anyway? I'm sure the note said 4:00 PM.
    0x01FF, // Ah yes… the note… slipped between the pages of my math book while I wasn't looking.
    0x0257, // As far as clichés go, I'm more a fan of the letter-in-the-locker, but at least this way shows a bit of initiative.

    0x046A, // A hesitating, barely audible question.
    0x0491, // However, I recognize the owner of that dainty voice instantly.
    0x04D0, // I feel my heart skip a beat.
    0x04ED, // It's a voice I've listened to hundreds of times, but never as more than an eavesdropper to a conversation.
    0x0558, // I turn to face this voice, the voice of my dreams, and my heart begins to race…
    0x05AA, // Iwanako? I got a note telling me to wait here… it was yours?
    0x05E9, // Dammit. I spent all afternoon trying to come up with a good line and that was the result.

    0x064D, // Ahmm… yes. I asked a friend to give you that note… I'm so glad you got it.
    0x069C, // A shy, joyous smile that makes me so tense I couldn't move a single muscle even if I tried.
    0x06F8, // My heart is pounding now, as if it were trying to burst out from my chest and claim this girl for itself.
    0x0762, // So… ah… here we are. Out in the cold…

    0x0963, // … if you'd go out with me…
    0x0982, // I stand there, motionless, save for my pounding heart.
    0x09B9, // I want to say something in reply, but my vocal cords feel like they've been stretched beyond the breaking point.
