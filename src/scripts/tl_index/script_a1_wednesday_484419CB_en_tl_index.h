    0x0068, // I feel a hand on my shoulder at the same time the girl's eyes widen in horror and whatever she was saying gets interrupted by a very horrified—{w=.9}{nw}
    0x0104, // Eep!
    0x0109, // I don't have time to look behind me because Shizune is already shoving me aside and stomping over to the girl, signing furiously at her.
    0x0192, // Miss Ibarazaki, I saw that. Running in the halls is strictly forbidden.
    0x01DA, // Misha translates, right on Shizune's tail, but her voice is girlishly playful, not full of the divine fury Shizune's arm movements would seem to call for.
    0x0275, // Er, sorry, I was just going to get some stuff, and I was in a kind of a hurry.
    0x02C4, // …
    0x02C8, // You've been told this a thousand times before. Your reckless behavior endangers other students, and even worse, it's explicitly against the school regulations.
    0x0368, // The girl blushes and starts to fidget nervously like a little child caught misbehaving.
    0x03C0, // It's so cute I find myself smiling.
    0x03E4, // I know that! I— I, um, I was just…
    0x040B, // …
    0x040F, // Make sure that this will not happen again… although I'm sure telling you this is futile, and only causes me further headache when you choose to ignore the regulations.
    0x04B9, // Got that, Emi?
    0x04C8, // The small girl sticks her tongue out in response.
    0x04FA, // Aaah!
    0x0500, // I gotta go!
    0x050C, // Teacher'll have my head! I promised to help with printouts, but I went running instead! Sorry, but I've gotta change and everything!
    0x0591, // Before Misha or Shizune or I can say anything, she's already bolted from where she was a second ago, almost halfway towards the stairwell.
    0x061C, // Shizune looks like she's about to go nuclear on the spot, so I smile at her in a vain attempt to calm her down.
    0x068C, // …
    0x0690, // Are you okay, Hicchan? That Ibarazaki girl is always like that, causing trouble to others.
    0x06EB, // You know, I'm pretty certain Shizune wouldn't call me 'Hicchan.'
    0x072C, // Never mind, never mind!
    0x0744, // …
    0x0748, // Yeah, anyway, I'm okay. Just got the wind knocked out of me.
    0x0785, // …
    0x0789, // That's great, Hicchan!
    0x07A0, // I wouldn't call that great, but I let it slide this one time.
    0x07DE, // …
    0x07E2, // So, let's hurry, Hicchan~! To have lunch!
    0x080C, // We promise it'll be great!
    0x0827, // I'll take your word for it. What kind of a place is it?
    0x085F, // A restaurant, or something?
    0x087B, // …
    0x087F, // It's a teahouse, Hicchan~!
    0x089A, // A teahouse… that sounds kind of fancy.
    0x08C3, // …
    0x08C7, // Why are you looking at your wallet, Hicchan? It's okay, if you don't have any money we'll cover for you~!
    0x0931, // That's really nice of you. Thanks.
    0x0954, // It's okay, Hicchan! After all, we're friends, right, Hicchan?
    0x0992, // It's only been three days. Are we really friends that quickly?
    0x09D1, // Heh. But, hearing that makes me happy.
    0x09F8, // …
    0x09FC, // Ah, it's only for today, though, and only if you accept right now! Do you want to go, Hicchan?
    0x0A5B, // I start wondering if this is some kind of trap. Is this Misha's suggestion or Shizune's? This is important. I'm still a little apprehensive about the possible motives of a girl whose favorite pastime is the game of world domination.
    0x0B44, // No, I'm just being paranoid. Actually, they have grown on me already, and I do have to go to town sometime. So why not now, with them?
    0x0BCB, // I've never actually been to a teahouse before. All my expectations are from what I've seen about them on TV. But those are period dramas, and these are modern times. It might just be a regular café, and they're just calling it a teahouse.
    0x0CBB, // Either way, I'm curious about that, too, so there's another reason for me to join them.
    0x0D13, // Sure.
    0x0D19, // That's great, Hicchan~! That's great, that's great! Yay~!
    0x0D53, // Misha hops up and down briefly to show how happy she is, which causes a few heads to turn towards us. Shizune opts for a polite, tiny clap that lasts for all of two seconds before she goes back to looking stoic as usual.
    0x0E30, // Would it kill you to be a little happier, Shizune?
    0x0E63, // …
    0x0E67, // Oh? I wasn't aware that Hicchan was a king. Hahahaha~!
    0x0E9E, // Shizune pushes her glasses up as Misha delivers her message totally without sarcasm. I guess it would sting more if she could say it with the intent Shizune meant behind it, so for once I'm happy to have Misha as a barrier between us.
    0x0F89, // I'm not telling you to jump for joy just because I'm having lunch with you. I'm not that arrogant.
    0x0FEC, // She seems to accept this, and we head for town with Shizune leading the way.
    0x1039, // …
    0x103D, // We have to run now, there is an important student council meeting regarding the festival. And we finally decided where to eat~!
    0x10BD, // …
    0x10C1, // Too bad you can't join, but this lunch meeting is only for council members.
    0x110D, // We can take you there some other time! Oh, but that'd be like a date, wouldn't it?
    0x1160, // Wahaha~!
    0x1169, // The girls leave for downstairs.
    0x1189, // I didn't manage to get far from the third floor hallway before all this commotion struck, literally. I should get going as well.
    0x120A, // The lunch and the afternoon class pass uneventfully.
    0x123F, // I read most of the book I had started yesterday, and eat some of the mostly inedible offerings of the cafeteria.
    0x12B0, // The class is tiresome.
