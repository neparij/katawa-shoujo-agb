    0x0000, // The students roll into class for the Saturday morning session, each and every one of them sporting the tired eyes of people who have worked through the night.
    0x009F, // With only a day left to prepare, I suppose it's not so surprising. Thankfully, we only have to suffer through classes until the lunch break, and then our time is our own.
    0x014A, // Mutou lurches into class in a tired stagger. I suppose students aren't the only people here that enjoy their late Friday nights.
    0x01CB, // Without saying a word, he scrawls some page and question numbers on the board and slumps down at his desk.
    0x0236, // It's completely atypical behavior for him, but it appears that no one in the class is going to call him out on it.
    0x02A9, // Wordlessly, the students shuffle their textbooks into position and get to work. Not wanting to break the trend, I do the same.
    0x0328, // Fatigue has made the class antisocial; not a peep is heard among the ruffling papers.
    0x037E, // That can partly be attributed to the two empty seats beside me. For some reason Misha and Shizune aren't present; probably doing council work for the festival.
    0x041E, // It's very quiet without Misha present.
    0x0445, // I wonder if she was born as rowdy as she is, or if she is 'making up' for Shizune's lack of voice.
    0x04A8, // Nakai, can I speak to you for a moment?
    0x04D0, // I'm so engrossed in thinking about Misha that I don't even notice Mutou approaching my desk.
    0x052D, // Sure… what's this about?
    0x0548, // It's probably better if we speak outside the classroom…
    0x0582, // Something about this doesn't sound too good, but I stand up and follow him out into the hallway.
    0x05E3, // Mutou stands in the hallway, scratching his head as he works out what he is trying to say. Not knowing what's going on, I wait silently.
    0x066C, // So then, onto my next question; how are you finding your studies? I understand you were laid up for a while. We're not too far ahead, are we?
    0x06FA, // I don't really think so. I tried to keep up when I was in the hospital, so it hasn't been too hard.
    0x075E, // Mutou taps his chin and raises an eyebrow as he absorbs this information.
    0x07A8, // Is that so… I suppose there are still students out there who realize the importance of learning…
    0x080D, // I wouldn't go that far, I was only trying to keep myself occupied in my little life-support prison.
    0x0871, // Well, yeah. You've got to keep up with these things, right?
    0x08AD, // That's exactly it. One wrong move in this world and you're left behind, right?
    0x08FC, // Er, right. Wouldn't want that to happen.
    0x0925, // No, no you wouldn't. Every week there's a new scientific discovery. Most of them mean nothing to the layperson, but any one of them could be the key to the Next Big Thing.
    0x09D1, // I'll keep that in mind…
    0x09EB, // It's obvious that Mutou's Serious Talk is over, and he's gone back to his standard, slightly scatterbrained approach to life.
    0x0A69, // I think, in hindsight, that I prefer him this way. He's slightly more predictable in his unpredictability.
    0x0AD4, // Well then, I think that's all I really had to say. Let's get back inside, shall we?
    0x0B28, // My relief at that suggestion is insurmountable.
    0x0B58, // Sure. You're the boss, right?
    0x0B76, // Mutou pauses for a moment.
    0x0B91, // I don't think any of my students have ever said that to me before.
    0x0BD4, // For an instant I consider replying to this, but something deep within me tells me to shut my mouth and get back into the classroom.
    0x0C58, // A few of the students jump at the sound of the door, rapidly trying to pretend that they are working on the questions on the board.
    0x0CDC, // Some don't even bother, their heads slumped on the desk as they nap. Thankfully, it would appear that Mutou does not even notice them.
    0x0D63, // He returns to his desk and retrieves a scientific journal from one of the drawers. I guess I got to him there.
    0x0DD2, // The class returns to the near-silence that Mutou and I left it in before our chat.
    0x0E25, // Mixed feelings of tiredness and anticipation buzz around the room. Everyone here is either waiting for a chance to rest or the chance to get their last-minute preparations underway.
    0x0EDB, // The clock on the wall slowly ticks the remaining class time away, until finally the bells cry out, ending the torment.
    0x0F52, // Before you all leave, I expect the answers for those problems by Monday.
    0x0F9B, // The class sighs as one, instantly regretting slacking off, but still acutely aware of the more pressing issues at hand.
    0x1013, // The classroom empties in a blink as everyone rushes to their last-minute festival preparations.
    0x1073, // I stay behind and try to quickly finish the questions so I don't have to bother with it over the rest of the weekend, with the festival and all tomorrow.
    0x110D, // Apart from me, Hanako is the only one left, obviously waiting for Lilly.
    0x1156, // It's weird that Lilly comes all the way to our classroom to pick her up. I expect that moving around is at least nominally harder for her than it is for Hanako.
    0x11F7, // But it's none of my business, and I naturally don't ask about it from Hanako.
    0x1245, // Despite the relative proximity of our seats, neither tries to strike up a conversation about that or anything else either, so an oppressive silence falls upon the classroom.
    0x12F3, // Time passes in silence. It's probably just fifteen minutes or so but it feels longer. I turn pages of my notebook. Hanako turns pages of the novel she's reading.
    0x1395, // My pencil lead splinters against the paper just when I was about to finish a paragraph.
    0x13ED, // The sounds of my irritated sigh and subsequent fumbling around for a sharpener feel like they're breaking the mood in the classroom.
    0x1472, // Hanako keeps her eyes firmly away from my direction.
    0x14A7, // Before long, Lilly's tall figure appears in the doorway.
    0x14E0, // Hanako?
    0x14E8, // Her name is all it takes to make Hanako jump up from her desk and run to Lilly.
    0x1538, // They talk quietly for a moment, but it isn't long before Lilly leaves down the hall and Hanako idles back into the classroom, taking her seat once again.
    0x15D2, // I watch Hanako out of the corner of my eye out of sheer curiosity at the idea that the two would be separated.
    0x1641, // For a couple of minutes, she does nothing but sit with her chin in her hand, staring at the desk dejectedly.
    0x16AE, // The boredom evidently becomes too much for her though, her slender frame reaching into her bag and pulling out a small book.
    0x172B, // Come to think of it, that isn't the one I saw her reading at the library. She must be quite a fast reader to get through them at this rate.
    0x17B7, // I heard from the school's head nurse that you had an incident the other day.
    0x1804, // Ah. So it's about that.
    0x181C, // Well, kind of, but it's not anything to be worried about.
    0x1856, // Yes, yes it is. Anything that can endanger your health is something to be worried about.
    0x18AF, // We try our best here to prepare you for life here. Part of that involves knowing your limits, and how to work around them.
    0x192A, // It would be remiss of me if I didn't speak up about this.
    0x1964, // All right, I get it. I'm sorry.
    0x1984, // Mutou closes his eyes in frustration, and I realize that this probably wasn't the best thing to say.
    0x19E9, // Something tells me that you're not sorry. Pretend as much as you want, but this isn't a normal school.
    0x1A50, // A lot of people have put in a lot of time, effort, and money to make sure that you, and every other student here, can have the same level of education as your peers.
    0x1AF6, // For you to abuse that by throwing out advice, especially medical advice, is plain selfish.
    0x1B51, // I'm not quite sure if this is actually how he feels, or if it is some act that he's practiced many times to guilt-trip students into doing the 'right' thing. Either way, it's working.
    0x1C09, // I understand. This is all new to me, and I apologize. I know my limits now, and I'll be sticking to them.
    0x1C73, // Mutou appears to lighten up a little, satisfied that his message has been received.
    0x1CC7, // So, tell me, how are things?
    0x1CE4, // Things?
    0x1CEC, // I expected Mutou to be a little vague, but this is pushing the limits.
    0x1D33, // You know. Things. You've had a week to settle in now, so how are things?
    0x1D7C, // Er, fine I guess.
    0x1D8E, // I see. And how is your… condition?
    0x1DB3, // The pause before 'condition' seemed a little unnecessary.
    0x1DED, // Haven't had any problems so far.
    0x1E0E, // A brief shimmer of relief passes across Mutou's face.
    0x1E44, // Good, that's good. The school nurse was a little concerned that you might have been pushing yourself a bit too hard.
    0x1EB9, // He asked me to keep an eye on you when he couldn't.
    0x1EED, // That makes sense…
    0x1F01, // I'd ask that you don't blow us off so freely. As much as we try to give you the level of education that you would get at a normal school, you have to realize that you have limits.
    0x1FB5, // Our goal is to make sure that you know where those limits are, and how to maximize your potential within them. Do you follow me?
    0x2036, // I guess. I mean, I don't plan on doing anything stupid.
    0x206E, // Well, that's a start, I guess.
    0x208D, // After about ten minutes of restlessly shuffling in her seat and trying to read, Hanako closes her book and leaves too.
    0x2104, // As should I, since the assignment is all but finished and there is nothing else to do in the classroom.
    0x216C, // Not really feeling energetic, I just go straight to my room and read for the rest of the day.
