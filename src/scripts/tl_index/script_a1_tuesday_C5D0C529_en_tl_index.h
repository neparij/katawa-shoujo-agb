    0x0000, // My first impression was right; the library is surprisingly big.
    0x0040, // Ambling down the narrow aisles, I study the spines of the books in random order, occasionally sliding one out to read the blurb, taking it with me if it looks good.
    0x00E5, // In a few moments I have a respectable stack of books in my arms.
    0x0126, // I guess I'll never be stuck for choice in here.
    0x0156, // The normality of the library sinks in. Sure, there are large-print and Braille books scattered throughout, but it is what it is: a library.
    0x01E2, // It's as if the calm mood from the room I had tea with Lilly in snuck with us in here, unless it was here to begin with.
    0x025A, // Something about that puts me at ease, just like before.
    0x0292, // I reach the end of the aisle and find a collection of desks, set up for study or personal reading. Going a little further, though, I discover a nice quiet corner at the back.
    0x0341, // While the rest of the library has the odd student sitting at a desk either reading or stealthily sleeping, the back is pretty much deserted.
    0x03CE, // As I glance around, I see someone who I recognize sitting on one of several beanbags.
    0x0424, // It's the dark-haired girl from my class. The one who snuck out of the classroom earlier.
    0x047D, // She's reading a book, keeping it close to her face which makes her look like she's really into it.
    0x04E0, // From the way she was acting today, I had her pegged as more of a delinquent than a bookworm. In fact, her mysterious disappearance from the class raises all sorts of whys in my head.
    0x0597, // Intrigue floats slowly but surely towards the surface, and before I know it I'm walking towards the mysterious long-haired girl.
    0x0618, // I guess there's no harm in introducing myself as I would with anyone else. She's a classmate after all.
    0x0680, // Walking over to another beanbag, I take a seat and lay my books beside it.
    0x06CB, // The girl starts, looking scaredly up at me from underneath her fringe.
    0x0712, // This is the first time I've seen her this close. Underneath her long, dense bangs, I can see that part of her face, at least a third if not a half, is pretty badly scarred.
    0x07BF, // My eyes are immediately drawn to the scars, subconsciously peeking past her hair until they meet her own eyes.
    0x082E, // For a second, I am shocked, and divert my eyes to the book in her hands, before I realize that looking away probably only makes it worse.
    0x08B8, // I…
    0x08BD, // I… I…
    0x08C7, // I…?
    0x08CD, // Ivegottogodosomething!
    0x08E4, // Without warning, Hanako takes off and runs towards the counter.
    0x0924, // Her hare-like takeoff catches me so off guard that I don't manage to go after her until she has a good head start.
    0x0997, // By the time I reach the counter she is nowhere to be seen.
    0x09D2, // Lilly and Yuuko are happily chatting away.
    0x09FD, // Knowing that I won't be able to catch Hanako myself, I approach the girls.
    0x0A48, // Hey, did you see… er… notice a girl run past here?
    0x0A7F, // Um, maybe… what did she look like?
    0x0AA4, // Long, dark hair. Kinda shy. She had… well… some scars… on her… face.
    0x0AF1, // You wouldn't be talking about Hanako, would you?
    0x0B22, // Yeah, that's her. I saw her reading and tried to talk to her, but I think I scared her off or something.
    0x0B8B, // Oh dear. Yuuko, would you excuse me, I had better try and find her.
    0x0BCF, // S-sure. I'll just hold onto these until you come back.
    0x0C06, // Um, what's going on?
    0x0C1B, // I'm sorry, but I'll have to explain it to you some other time.
    0x0C5A, // Right. I'll see you later then…
    0x0C7C, // Lilly hastily grabs her cane and hurries out of the library, leaving me alone with Yuuko.
    0x0CD6, // I don't think I'll ever get the hang of this place.
    0x0D0A, // Did I do something wrong?
    0x0D24, // What did you do?
    0x0D35, // But how should I deal with these people? Forcing myself to act overly casually only makes me feel phony.
    0x0D9E, // Like I was supposed to be ignoring the elephant in the room.
    0x0DDB, // Yuuko fidgets, looking like she wants to say something to that, but resists it.
    0x0E2B, // I think it's an elephant only if you feel that way.
    0x0E5F, // I guess she doesn't have a good sense of self-restraint. It makes me smile, and she blushes heavily.
    0x0EC4, // W… what? Did that sound stupid?
    0x0EE6, // No no, it sounded really wise. I guess you're right. It's more about me than anyone else.
    0x0F40, // Neither of us has anything to add so Yuuko fills the silence by shuffling some papers around.
    0x0F9E, // People who have papers on their desks really like doing that.
    0x0FDC, // Did you find any books? I should be closing soon. I mean this library should be closing. But I have to do it. I hope that's not too inconvenient for you.
    0x1076, // Oh. Yeah, I want some books, but I left them over there because…
    0x10B9, // …I'll just go get them.
    0x10D3, // I fetch my stack of books from beside the beanbags where Hanako and I were sitting and return to the counter.
    0x1141, // Wow. You read a lot, don't you?
    0x1161, // I surprise myself with that too, honestly. At least, when I really think about it.
    0x11B4, // I had a lot of free time earlier this year, so I just kind of… started reading books to fill that time. I couldn't do much else.
    0x1237, // I see.
    0x123E, // But she doesn't say anything else, and just checks out my books for me.
    0x1286, // I guess this is what they call 'tact.'
    0x12AD, // Hi! I'm new here. Hisao Nakai. We're in the same class.
    0x12E5, // I'm sorry, I didn't mean to startle you.
    0x130E, // Nothing! I just… talked to her. Tried to get to know her. Didn't even manage to get started.
    0x136D, // Yuuko sighs and looks awfully bothered, even more so than she did before.
    0x13B7, // I guess you weren't 'wrong' so much as 'tactless.'
    0x13EA, // Tactless?
    0x13F4, // That girl is a bit of a special case. It's like she never really talks to anyone.
    0x1446, // Isn't that a bit… strange?
    0x1463, // I wonder… It's just how she is, I think.
    0x148E, // Yuuko doesn't sound all that convincing. Then again, maybe this is just the norm around here.
    0x14EC, // Everyone has their own problems, or else they wouldn't be here.
    0x152C, // Perhaps I was being a little tactless after all.
    0x155D, // Nothing! I was just looking for some books and then she got this fit and ran off.
    0x15AF, // The most offending thing I can think of was that I might've looked at her general direction a few times.
    0x1618, // Well, she is a very timid girl.
    0x1638, // You have to be very careful around her. She can be very jumpy, I think, and she's not accustomed to talking with other people.
    0x16B7, // Isn't that a bit… strange?
    0x16D4, // I wonder… It's just how she is, I think.
    0x16FF, // Yuuko doesn't sound all that convincing. Then again, maybe this is just the norm around here.
    0x175D, // Everyone has their own problems, or else they wouldn't be here.
