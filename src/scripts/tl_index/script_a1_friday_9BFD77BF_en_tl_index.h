    0x0000, // Back in my room, the first thing I see is the familiar row of medication bottles lined up on top of my dresser, and it makes me depressed, as usual.
    0x0095, // It's annoying. I thought I was okay. I thought I had made my peace with this thing, gotten over it.
    0x00F9, // But what I really did… I allowed myself to forget that I have a problem. Being here really reminds me of the reality, and trying to fight against it just hurts.
    0x019C, // Reflecting on it is only going to do so much. I've done this before, for months. It seems like it's time to get over it.
    0x0215, // If I allow myself to forget that my life is definitely not going to be as long as those of others, I won't get anywhere.
    0x028E, // My life may be different from others. But it is a life in progress.
    0x02D2, // That is how I'll rationalize it.
    0x02F3, // I down the usual handful of pills, trying to push the sudden dreary feeling out of my head. Then I prepare to head out to class early, as usual.
    0x0384, // As I step into the hallway, I notice Kenji coming around the hallway corner, stealthily making his way over to his own room with a large bag. As he sneaks past me soundlessly like a ninja hiding in plain sight, I call out to him.
    0x046A, // Hey.
    0x046F, // He jumps at the sound of my voice.
    0x0492, // Oh, hey, man. I didn't notice you there. I'm really tired.
    0x04CD, // I think it's more like he didn't see me, but that's not the issue.
    0x0510, // Where have you been this early? Shopping?
    0x053A, // Nah, I wasn't shopping. Sometimes I have to visit… the math teacher. Yeah, I figured it would be a good idea to find out when the next exam is, since he tells you in advance if you want.
    0x05F7, // So then, what's in the bag?
    0x0613, // I thought I'd go shopping while I was outside. I need supplies to continue the fight against the vast feminist conspiracy.
    0x068E, // Uh, okay.
    0x0698, // I thought you didn't go outside.
    0x06B9, // I wear a hat now.
    0x06CB, // I decide to not point out that he is not wearing a hat.
    0x0703, // An awkward silence settles between us and then Kenji breaks it by pushing his door open slowly, releasing a creaking sound into the air that only makes the moment seem more awkward. He sets the bag down inside his room and then closes the door.
    0x07F8, // I'm surprised you went out of your way to find out a test date. Trying to take advantage of an opportunity to study is pretty diligent.
    0x0880, // I never study.
    0x088F, // Oh…
    0x0895, // I just wanted to know when the next test day was. I'm still going to take it, duh. I need to know so I know what day I can't afford to skip class. He usually sends out updates on that crap by phone, so I had to step out and check up on it.
    0x0985, // And why do you have to go out, when you can get it on your phone?
    0x09C7, // I don't carry a phone.
    0x09DE, // What do you mean you don't carry a phone? You mean you just leave it at home?
    0x0A2C, // Nah, I don't use phones. I don't have a phone. Phones. I have no phone.
    0x0A74, // Why don't you have a phone? How can you not have a phone? No phone at all? No phone?
    0x0AC9, // I just don't like phones. Actually, I'm kind of scared of them. I don't know why. I think it's some kind of repressed trauma.
    0x0B47, // But, basically, when I hear a phone, I get nervous. It's my darkest secret.
    0x0B93, // I have two theories on it: either I have some fear of receiving some undefined, ominous, life-altering doom call, or I was beaten with a phone in the past. Beaten so badly I can't remember it.
    0x0C54, // Beaten in the head.
    0x0C68, // Well, where else could I get beaten with a phone that would make me unable to remember it? The ass?
    0x0CCC, // Unexpectedly logical. I feel very depressed now. Sensing this conversation is more or less over, Kenji opens his door again and prepares to head inside.
    0x0D65, // Yeah, I'm going to sleep, dude. Have a good one.
    0x0D96, // Class is going to start in like twenty minutes.
    0x0DC6, // I already did something today. Too tired to go to school.
    0x0E00, // Hey, you need some lip balm? I accidentally bought two because I thought the store had started selling individual double A batteries.
    0x0E86, // Thanks but no thanks.
    0x0E9C, // I wake up and take a hot shower.
    0x0EBD, // Whatever, man.
    0x0ECC, // He swiftly enters his lair, finally letting me go to the class.
