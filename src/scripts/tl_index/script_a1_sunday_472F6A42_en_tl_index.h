    0x0050, // Sleeping late is fine, since it's a Sunday and there are no classes.
    0x0095, // Not just a Sunday, though, but the festival as well.
    0x00CA, // From my window I can already see some people at the soba booth slinging noodles onto plates for people with a craving for low-quality food.
    0x0156, // I throw back a handful of my morning meds and ponder how to spend the day.
    0x01A1, // There will be a few exams in the coming week, but I don't consider those as ominous as others, so I'm not as worried about them as I probably should be.
    0x023A, // With no urgent obligations regarding education, I should be free to spend the day at the festival as I like.
    0x02A7, // Finishing my morning routine, I exit into the hallway, intending to go out and find something to eat.
    0x030D, // Passing by his door, I decide to see what Kenji's up to today out of impulse.
    0x035B, // I'm curious if he has any plans, since everyone is doing something.
    0x039F, // Then again, I can picture him having built a soundproof shelter in his room.
    0x03EC, // Or possibly something like a fort, complete with 'No Girls Allowed' sign.
    0x0436, // … and with the 'Girls' crossed out and 'body' crudely scrawled underneath it.
    0x0486, // Knocking on his door which is luckily devoid of any kind of sign, I hear again the unsettling clicking of at least ten locks being pulled back. The door opens up a crack.
    0x0531, // Who is it?
    0x053C, // You're supposed to ask that before you open the door.
    0x0572, // Oh, it's you. Damn, it's early.
    0x0592, // It's not really that early.
    0x05AE, // What is it, man?
    0x05BF, // Nothing, was just gonna ask what you're gonna do today.
    0x05F7, // Half the school is out there already.
    0x061D, // Out where? Why?
    0x062D, // What?
    0x0633, // What what? Is today special? Why are they there? Who are?
    0x066D, // I can hear them. It's loud… don't tell me… Has the invasion begun?
    0x06B4, // He suddenly looks more alarmed.
    0x06D4, // What day is it, man?
    0x06E9, // Yeah I guess you can't see the big wooden booths outside, and people selling stuff…
    0x073F, // What the hell are you talking about? I have my curtains closed at all times to thwart the snipers.
    0x07A2, // Uhh, it's the festival. You know that… right?
    0x07D2, // Oh shit, that's today? Ah, damn. Ah… damn. Dammit.
    0x0807, // I can't believe I forgot, I don't have my fort finished yet. This is bad.
    0x0851, // This is going to be a very bad day… It's good you told me this, man. This is going to be a bad day.
    0x08B7, // Why?
    0x08BC, // Oh man, they're going to be everywhere. The people. Outside my window. Socializing!
    0x0910, // Kenji rubs his temples nervously, suddenly looking very ill.
    0x094D, // It's going to be loud as hell. Damn, and I was going to go out today, but now it's ruined, everything is ruined.
    0x09BE, // This is awful. This sucks. This sucks!
    0x09E5, // What the hell, this really sucks. I can't go anywhere now. There's nowhere to run.
    0x0A38, // Kenji seems nervous. You could even say he's majorly freaking out.
    0x0A7B, // I can't believe this. So that's what today was.
    0x0AAB, // Damn, and I couldn't even prepare for it.
    0x0AD5, // I couldn't even brace myself and now it's here and I can't do anything. You should have told me this earlier, dude. I mean, at least, I know, but… I could have known earlier! Imagine what I could have accomplished…
    0x0BB0, // Sorry. I thought you knew.
    0x0BCB, // So I guess you're not going to do anything today?
    0x0BFD, // The weather is even good. Yesterday was really windy, so I thought today would be cold. It's not, though, so there's no reason to just stay inside. Yeah, you should check the festival out.
    0x0CBA, // Kenji groans and covers his face with his hands.
    0x0CEB, // Agh, no, no! I can't do it. They'll eat me alive out there, I know it.
    0x0D32, // That has to be a joke, but he said it with such a straight face. Relatively straight.
    0x0D88, // What are you going to do? We should hang out in here, you can help me build my fort. We might still make it if we work together.
