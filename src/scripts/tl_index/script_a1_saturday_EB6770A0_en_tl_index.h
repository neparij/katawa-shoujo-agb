    0x0000, // I guess I'm a little interested in the art club.
    0x0031, // I blurt it out, partially inadvertently.
    0x005A, // What do you mean?
    0x006C, // Nothing… specific.
    0x0081, // I wonder if I could come by sometime. Even if it's just to observe or something.
    0x00D2, // I've been thinking that I should join some club or something, so…
    0x0116, // It's in no way a premeditated move, but a vague sense of determination has really been building inside of me for this past week.
    0x0197, // I want to do something. I want to belong somewhere.
    0x01CB, // It might as well be the art club, my shortcomings notwithstanding.
    0x020E, // The teacher seems pleased.
    0x0229, // Oh? You want to join? Well, we always welcome new people, of course.
    0x026E, // Club meetings are normal enough. We study various aspects of the fine arts and try our hands at them, as well.
    0x02DD, // Or feet.
    0x02E6, // He gives an embarrassed cough, but Rin doesn't seem to mind. I take a small amount of comfort from the fact that I'm not the only one with vocabulary difficulties in this school.
    0x0399, // Nomiya rebounds from his faux pas by theatrically checking the time from his huge, gleaming pocket watch, and slaps his forehead even more theatrically.
    0x0432, // I really must take my leave now, but if you have questions, I'm sure Tezuka can clarify.
    0x048B, // Somehow, mentioning 'clarify' and Rin in the same sentence doesn't feel right. However, I don't say as much to the teacher, since he seems to be in a hurry.
    0x0528, // Tezuka, I'm pleased to see that this little project is going so well.
    0x056E, // I just stopped by to remind you to not run off by yourself, tomorrow. I've invited certain people to the festival for you, and I'm sure they'd like to meet you as well.
    0x0617, // I hope I'll see you on Monday, then, Nakai.
    0x0643, // The teacher leaves, and we are left by ourselves again. Rin is still painting as if nothing notable happened. Since nothing in fact did, I am left wondering what on Earth is wrong with me.
    0x0700, // Art and I haven't worked well together in the past, at least judging from the grades I used to have in middle school.
    0x0776, // Maybe a club will be different than an obligatory class. Who knows?
    0x07BA, // I try to come up with something meaningful to ask about it, but to no avail.
    0x0807, // I'll just go to a club meeting and see how it goes.
    0x083B, // So he invited some people tomorrow just to check out your painting?
    0x087F, // He has a lot of art-people friends. They like to talk about art.
    0x08C0, // I think he wants me to talk about art with them.
    0x08F1, // Somehow, I get the feeling that you aren't too thrilled about it.
    0x0933, // Rin shrugs noncommittally, but it still gives an impression of her general displeasure at the idea of having to discuss her painting, or any painting, with other people.
    0x09DD, // I don't really like talking about art. It is already a way to talk without talking, so why bother talking about it?
    0x0A51, // I can understand that.
    0x0A68, // It's like being bored and talking about being bored, because you are bored.
    0x0AB4, // I'm not following you.
    0x0ACB, // Have you ever talked about being bored? It's pointless and not very exciting. All you can really say about it is 'I'm so bored.' I once spent a week trying to think of something meaningful to say about boredness.
    0x0BA0, // It was the most boring week I've ever had.
    0x0BCB, // But that's pretty fitting, don't you think?
    0x0BF7, // Rin gives me a look, the laconic kind that looks like it doesn't mean anything but it does.
    0x0C53, // Anyway… I don't know, I guess I just rarely can come up with anything to say about art.
    0x0CAD, // I mean, like this one you're doing now. I have no idea what to think about it, except that it looks nice. What is this painting about?
    0x0D34, // It's not about anything at all.
    0x0D54, // …
    0x0D58, // That's what I'd like to say. So I did.
    0x0D7F, // But that was a small lie. I said it anyway because I would kind of like it to be true.
    0x0DD6, // Teacher wanted me to do this, but I didn't have any ideas. I tried to have some, but nothing happened.
    0x0E3D, // So now this is a painting without any ideas.
    0x0E6A, // But… what are you painting then?
    0x0E8D, // No idea.
    0x0E96, // Come to think of it, I think I'll call this 'No idea.'
    0x0ECD, // Ah, now I started thinking again. This is bad.
    0x0EFC, // She shakes her head vigorously for a while, trying to shake 'thinking' out of her head. That amber-red hair flies wildly around.
    0x0F7D, // This is why I had Emi help me. She makes it easy to not think about anything.
    0x0FCB, // You know, how she just talks talks talks about nothing for hours. It's like her head is made of bubblegum foam bath jelly.
    0x1046, // You are kinda the same, but not really. It's very helpful if you stay here.
    0x1092, // I am not sure if that's a compliment or not. It's probably neither; with Rin being the overtly neutral person she is.
    0x1108, // So is there anything specific you'd like me to do to make you not think?
    0x1151, // Just be.
    0x115A, // So without knowing what I should do, I just sit on an empty box to watch her continue with the painting, idly leafing the pages of the beer-drinking book.
    0x11F5, // Rin has a serene expression on her face, her dark green eyes hiding what she might think behind them. No wait, she's supposedly not thinking anything, right?
    0x1293, // She quietly hums to a tune, interrupting every now and then with polite requests for more paint or another kind of brush.
    0x130D, // Her concentration is admirable, even though she seems to be sleep-deprived and under pressure to finish the job.
    0x137E, // Inch by inch the painting gains more form, details being added on top of details, colors entwining with each other, filling the empty spaces, growing on top of each other.
    0x142A, // I find myself thinking about inspiration and motivation to create art again.
    0x1477, // Where does one get ideas? They don't come out of nowhere, and I don't think there are muses that magically inject some inspiration in your head.
    0x1508, // Ideas have an origin and a purpose.
    0x152C, // The more I think about it, the more I'm convinced that Rin is lying about her mural, or at least twisting the truth. Maybe she doesn't even realize it, herself.
    0x15CD, // You can't do anything creative without having an idea of what you are going to create. That would go against the definition.
    0x164A, // Every stroke must be decided to be drawn. Even if it's made at random, then that, too, is a conscious decision.
    0x16BA, // So her painting, even this one, must be based on having some deliberate goal or idea of what to paint.
    0x1721, // If Rin's idea is to have no idea, as she said, does that count as having an idea?
    0x1773, // A logical paradox? That seems to be Rin's modus operandi for most normal interactions, so it wouldn't surprise me if she hadn't even noticed this herself.
    0x180E, // I wonder if I should bring it up, but I'm not sure if I want to engage in an argument about logic with this girl.
    0x1880, // One of us would probably end up short-circuiting fairly quickly, so I discard the thought.
    0x18DB, // Rin is squirming and shuffling restlessly.
    0x1906, // Even her usual blank visage breaks occasionally into pretty difficult looking expressions, the kind that one doesn't just come up with accidentally.
    0x199B, // Everything all right?
    0x19B1, // Yes. No.
    0x19BA, // My back started hurting again.
    0x19D9, // This painting is too big, after all, and it's hard to paint in this position.
    0x1A27, // Want to take a break?
    0x1A3D, // After I finish this part.
    0x1A57, // Of course, she doesn't take a break, and I don't bring it up again because that would be completely and utterly pointless.
    0x1AD2, // Rin continues her work and I stay with her: I like to watch her paint, and I'm going to be a member of the same club she's in, now.
    0x1B56, // When she declares the mural to be finished, it's already so dark that I have no idea how she can tell.
    0x1BBD, // There is no celebration, no general sense of a job well done, just a tired and laconic 'I'm done' and then we both go to sleep.
