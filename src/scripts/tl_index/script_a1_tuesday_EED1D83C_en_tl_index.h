    0x0196, // I mean, Shicchan, not me.

    0x01B4, // Getting control of North America is ambitious, because it provides a five army bonus, but you can attack it from three fronts, so you must defend them all~!

    0x0255, // I thought you'd have more guts. How disappointing.
    0x0288, // Ambition, Hicchan, your play needs to be more daring! Ambition, ambition~!

    0x0612, // Fine, I'll consider joining the council, but I want to take a look at the clubs before I decide.
    0x0673, // Really, Hicchan? You're not just saying that to make us feel better?
    0x06B8, // Yeah yeah, I'm just not sure that I want to.
    0x06E5, // Aw…
    0x06EB, // …
    0x06EF, // Okay, Hicchan, but we're not going to give up so easily. You said 'maybe;' there's still a chance you'll come around~!

    0x0830, // …
    0x0834, // Wahaha~! Surely you are not that horrible at board games? Maybe we can play a game you know then, to give you a handicap.
    0x08AE, // I might have said that just to make you feel better, after all.
    0x08EE, // Awww, that's cold, Hicchan…
