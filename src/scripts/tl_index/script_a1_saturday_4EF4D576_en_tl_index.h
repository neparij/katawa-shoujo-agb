    0x0000, // Emi heaves a sigh.
    0x0013, // I guess I have to go back and get some.
    0x003B, // I promised to help with our class project, though, so I'll be back a bit later. Can you manage without it for a few hours?
    0x00B6, // Rin nods, and so Emi leaves.
    0x00D3, // I stay because I like watching Rin paint, and because I have nothing better to do.
    0x0126, // I sit on a box and pick up today's book from my bag. It's a story about three guys drinking beer for two weeks straight and doing little else.
    0x01B5, // Rin moves from the spot that was in need of the blue and starts slowly working on another.
    0x0210, // Her foot works the brush steadily against the plastered wall. Layers of paint on top of layers of paint. The mural slowly gains more form.
    0x029B, // I turn the pages at a leisurely pace. In this chapter they are drinking beer at the protagonist's friend's place. In the previous ones it was the protagonist's own apartment.
    0x034A, // It's not a page-turner kind of book, a slice of someone's imaginary life that makes me wonder why it had to be written.
    0x03C2, // Why indeed. The reason for doing something creative… it's something incomprehensible.
    0x041A, // Like why Rin does paintings. It feels like she and Emi are the same, going squarely against their fates as if it's just out of spite.
    0x04A0, // Rin even said something like that. 'Do something you can't just because you can.'
    0x04F2, // Is that what she meant? Is that her reason? It might be Emi's, she comes off as quite a headstrong person.
    0x055D, // Rin doesn't give off that kind of an air. Thinking about it, she doesn't give off any kind of air, or maybe a different kind every time I talk with her.
    0x05F6, // Why did she say what she said? Why does she, or anyone at all paint, or draw, or sculpt, or write?
    0x0659, // I've never had much of a creative impulse so I don't think I can really understand it.
    0x06B0, // It makes me feel hollow inside.
    0x06D0, // What a grim thought. I can't really decide whether it's true or not, either.
    0x071D, // Am I content being this way? I can't deny I'm feeling a little bit envious of Rin, but I can't really consider it a flaw of any kind.
    0x07A3, // I'm myself and she is herself.
    0x07C2, // Still, I do need to find something. Something that could… make me feel a little less lost about myself, instead of just drowning myself in these books as I did in the hospital.
    0x0875, // I can't help but feel disoriented; the new school, lifestyle and people around me contribute heavily to this sensation.
    0x08ED, // I'm trying my best to fit into existing social circles, and most of the people I've met have been really nice.
    0x095C, // It still feels like I'm an outsider, though; like I don't belong.
    0x099E, // I shake the feeling off, realizing that I'm spacing out. I have neither turned a page of the book, nor done anything for Rin.
    0x0A1C, // She is trying to pour some paint from a big can using only her feet, having not bothered to ask me. Or maybe she did, and I didn't hear it.
    0x0AA8, // Either way, it looks very unstable.
    0x0ACC, // I quickly jump to help her, as it looks like she's about to spill the entire contents of the can all over the pavement.
    0x0B44, // I take the can from her feet and pour some in the bowl.
    0x0B7C, // She doesn't say anything, and neither do I. I catch a glimpse of her eyes, looking silently at me from under her unkempt bangs.
    0x0BFC, // It's an unreadable expression, a perfect poker face, mixed with a hint of something like a mild surprise.
    0x0C66, // I wonder what she is thinking. Maybe she is wondering about what I'm thinking. Maybe nothing.
    0x0CC4, // A penny for your thoughts.
    0x0CDF, // Do you have any pennies with you?
    0x0D01, // I don't think I do.
    0x0D15, // Then I don't think I will tell. I'm not thinking anything either, so you're in luck. Except now I just did.
    0x0D81, // She frowns, looking very unsatisfied.
    0x0DA7, // It's hard to not think about anything. But it's important.
    0x0DE2, // I'm about to ask why it's important when some old guy walks up to us, looking like he has some business with Rin.
    0x0E54, // Good afternoon. How's it going?
    0x0E74, // I can make it.
    0x0E83, // Rin doesn't take her eyes off the wall and responds so naturally that I can only assume they know each other.
    0x0EF1, // I haven't seen the man before, so I naturally wonder who he might be. Maybe a teacher?
    0x0F48, // His hair has faded to a silvery gray, so much so that it looks artificially dyed. I hope that's not the case.
    0x0FB6, // Small round glasses hang on the bridge of his nose, but it appears he's constantly looking over the lenses, rather than through them.
    0x103C, // He's studying the mural intently over said glasses.
    0x1070, // Good, good.
    0x107C, // What bold composition you have here!
    0x10A1, // He moves to inspect the mural closer, talking to himself about it in a way that makes it obvious he wants us to hear it too.
    0x111E, // Very good, very good indeed…
    0x113D, // I don't really know what to make of it but Rin doesn't seem to care much. She's looking around her working space, the various bowls of different tones scattered all over.
    0x11E8, // Hisao.
    0x11EF, // Hmm?
    0x11F4, // A little more of this.
    0x120B, // Give me a second.
    0x121D, // I pour a 50-50 mix of two paints into the bowl to create more of the same pale pink tone Rin was using to fill up the shape of a man's face.
    0x12AA, // Rin watches me doing so, which makes me feel nervous somehow. Her face is so unassuming that it feels she's just waiting for me to do something wrong.
    0x1341, // The man turns to reckon me as well, looking surprised as if he noticed my presence only just now.
    0x13A3, // …Maybe he did.
    0x13B4, // Why, hello there. Who might you be?
    0x13D8, // Ah, I'm a transfer student to class 3-3. Hisao Nakai. Nice to meet you.
    0x1420, // Mutou's class, eh? Well, I won't hold that against you!
    0x1458, // He laughs very loudly. Obnoxiously loudly. A few small birds take flight from a nearby tree.
    0x14B5, // I'm Shinichi Nomiya, the art teacher.
    0x14DB, // So this is the art teacher. In retrospect, should have guessed that much. He even looks like one, as far as first impressions go.
    0x155D, // How did you come to end up assisting my protégée?
    0x1591, // I just kinda stuck with her, I think.
    0x15B7, // I'm interested in the art club.
