    0x00DC, // Although it must make her walking that much harder, Lilly takes it in stride.
    0x012A, // As we turn around the corner of the hallway, something hits me in the chest with the force of a steam train. Hanako shrieks a little and my vision briefly goes black.
    0x01D1, // Hisao, what happened?
    0x01E7, // She's not quite up to speed for obvious reasons, but she sounds very worried. More than what the situation deserves, really.
    0x0264, // Someone just bumped into me, nothing serious. Just winded.
    0x029F, // Er, sorry, it's my fault. I was just going to get some stuff, and I was in a kind of a hurry.
    0x02FD, // That 'someone' here is Emi, isn't it?

    0x04F5, // Aaah! I gotta go!
    0x0507, // Teacher'll have my head, I promised to help with printouts but I went running instead! Sorry, but I've gotta change and everything!

    0x05EC, // Does that kind of thing happen often around here?
    0x061E, // There are more rules in Yamaku than usual for running in corridors.
    0x0662, // …but that rarely stops Emi, it seems.
    0x068A, // She shakes her head weakly and offers a slight, composed smile.
    0x06CA, // I don't think there's anything we can do to stop her, I'm afraid. Shall we be off, then?
    0x0723, // Lilly heads off along the hallway, and Hanako hurries after her.
    0x0764, // The route to the room the two use for tea is fairly simple to retrace, being still fresh in my mind from yesterday.
