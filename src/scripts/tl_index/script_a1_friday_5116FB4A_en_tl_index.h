    0x0059, // Oh.
    0x005D, // Is it something that… is related to you being transferred here? I mean…
    0x00A9, // She cuts herself off rather abruptly, maybe realizing she was being a bit intrusive. Her instincts are sharp though, and while I don't like the subject it's not like I should lie about it.
    0x0166, // If it's Lilly, I don't think I mind.
    0x018B, // I'm just a little weak for the time being.
    0x01B6, // Hanako said you look fairly… healthy, so I naturally thought…
    0x01F8, // Lilly doesn't finish her sentence again, letting it trail off with a measure of concern.
    0x0251, // As she furrows her brow, Lilly's uncomfortable expression spurs me to say at least something to ease her feelings.
    0x02C4, // It's surprising she's this flustered, considering her straightforward attitude with her own blindness. She must know that not all share her own comfort about such things.
    0x036F, // No, it's okay.
    0x037E, // I have a pretty… I guess the best way to put it would be messed-up… heart. Arrhythmia.
    0x03D9, // I had a bad heart attack a while ago because of it, and spent most of the spring in a hospital. Ended in Yamaku on doctor's orders.
    0x045D, // She silently nods her head in acknowledgment.
    0x048B, // My answer, though, only seems to make Lilly furrow her brow even further. She doesn't seem to quite know how to react, given we don't really know each other that well.
    0x0533, // I can't really fault her for it, given I have the exact same reaction.
    0x057A, // While I do want to assuage her concern, I really don't want to dwell on this either.
    0x05CF, // Don't worry about it.
    0x05E5, // I try to offer a reassuring smile but then I realize the futility. Without knowing this, Lilly smiles at me reassuringly but doesn't say anything further.
    0x0680, // Arriving at the dorms, Rin stops in front of her mural as if lightning struck her. She had been so quiet for almost all of the walk back that I had all but forgotten she was here.
    0x0734, // It's Friday, isn't it?
    0x074B, // Yes… Friday, the eighth of June.
    0x076E, // This is bad.
    0x077B, // Bad? Why?
    0x0785, // I think I am going to go in a fetal position and throw up. Possibly in reverse order.
    0x07DB, // Is something wrong?
    0x07EF, // No. Nothing is wrong. It's Friday and nothing is wrong yet. This mural, it's going to need to be finished by Sunday. So everything's all right.
    0x087F, // Do you have any drugs? Or a time machine?
    0x08A9, // This is not good. Not good.
    0x08C5, // So she's behind her schedule. Recalling Shizune's exasperation at Rin's carefree attitude several days ago, I don't know what to think.
    0x094D, // She has left herself open for a 'told you so' unless she can pull off whatever she needs to pull off by Sunday morning.
    0x09C5, // Rin keeps staring at her mural looking as mortified as she can.
    0x0A05, // Leave me. I'm going to need to work for a while.
    0x0A36, // I glance at Lilly, expecting her to share an incredulous look with me as I roll my eyes, but then I realize she's not one to do that kind of thing.
    0x0ACA, // Leave me.
    0x0AD4, // We do, of course, not wanting to aggravate her any more than she already is.
    0x0B21, // There is a churning bad feeling in my gut. Rin sure has a knack of making people feel worried about her.
    0x0B8A, // She seems like a person who should never be left alone.
    0x0BC2, // Maybe we should call someone? She sounded like she was going into shock or something.
    0x0C18, // I'm sure she will be just fine. She's just a… eeeh… how to say…
    0x0C5E, // Lilly cocks her head a little, trying to find a polite way of calling Rin crazy without calling her crazy.
    0x0CC9, // Unique?
    0x0CD1, // Yes, a very unique person.
    0x0CEC, // I guess you could say that.
    0x0D08, // She giggles at the notion melodiously, nodding in agreement.
    0x0D45, // Sorry about leaving you stranded as you talked to her. I… don't really understand her, so I keep my distance.
    0x0DB5, // So my guess was right. Lilly offers a slight, apologetic smile as if she was sorry that her own shortcomings have prevented her from becoming closer to Rin.
    0x0E52, // I'm not one to blame her. At all.
    0x0E74, // Lilly lets slip a long breath, probably a disguised yawn. I imagine she's as exhausted by all this as I am.
    0x0EE0, // I'd better leave now and give these to Hanako. Thank you for the company, Hisao.
    0x0F31, // She smiles very sweetly at me. It feels different than normal, despite the fact that she seems to be smiling so often.
    0x0FA8, // I can't put my finger on what the difference is. It's just different.
    0x0FEE, // Relaxed, I'd say, but that's probably just relief over getting rid of Rin. Maybe.
    0x1040, // Yeah… good night. Say hi to Hanako for me.
    0x106D, // I will. Good night.
    0x1081, // To my surprise, in a moment's time her face shows that she comes to some sort of realization.
    0x10DF, // Wait… so the time when Emi and you collided in the hallway…?
    0x1120, // I grimace slightly. Her ability to connect the dots quite so fast is unexpected.
    0x1171, // Yeah. I guess I'm a textbook example of why those rules about running in the corridors exist.
    0x11CF, // That was a lot more dry than I'd intended. Lilly visibly shies away from continuing the topic.
