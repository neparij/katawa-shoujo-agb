    0x000E, // I quickly step in front of them, trying to hide the stuff behind my back. Shizune takes a step back, looking suspicious, but it's an expression not without concern.
    0x00B3, // I hope if I avoid it, she'll understand that I don't want her to keep prodding me about it.
    0x010F, // …
    0x0113, // Really? What are you hiding, Hicchan~?
    0x013A, // Nothing.
    0x0143, // …
    0x0147, // Is that so~?
    0x0154, // I realize I can't really squirm my way out of this. They are nosy by nature and hiding it is just going to pique their curiosity more.
    0x01DB, // Yeah okay, it is {b}something{/b}, but I don't really want to talk about it, okay? Not… yet.
    0x023A, // Can we just put this aside for now?
    0x025E, // As Misha translates, Shizune stares at me hard with her eyes focused and analytical as ever, peering at me curiously over the rims of her glasses.
    0x02F1, // Her fingers press against each other thoughtfully, as if she's weighing the value of pursuing this further than necessary against the insult of disrespecting my wish.
    0x0398, // Her expression finally melts into a slight smile and she signs something to Misha.
    0x03EB, // …
    0x03EF, // Okay~! Then, we'll wait, and become better and better friends, and one day when you feel like it, you can tell us about it~!
    0x046C, // Both of them smile widely at me, and I feel shocked and a little stupid about being like this.
    0x04CB, // They are not stupid, and probably can at least halfway guess what's going on with me. And…
    0x0528, // Such simple, kind words. I feel relieved that they don't think any worse of me even if I'm like this. Even if I'm not like the rest here. Even if I can't be at ease about it.
    0x05D7, // Seems that behind the obnoxious, mischievous acts, both of these girls are really kind and good people. That's what I think.
    0x0654, // Thanks.
    0x065C, // So, you want me to help you out today, right? Since I'm one of you now?
    0x06A4, // Yup~!
    0x06AA, // After class?
    0x06B7, // No no no~! Now!
    0x06C7, // Now? But what about class? You are going to skip again?
    0x06FF, // …
    0x0703, // Hahaha~! It's for the common good, so we sacrifice our math lessons, and maybe the social studies too~!
    0x076B, // Well, I guess I'm fine with it.
    0x078B, // …
    0x078F, // Awesome, Hicchan~! You said it, okay? Remember: 'I'm fine with helping out~,' that's what you said, right~?
    0x07FB, // Yeah.
    0x0801, // That tone… I suddenly regret saying it.
    0x082B, // …
    0x082F, // Okay~! Are you ready to go then? We can go to the office together~!
    0x0873, // No. You're probably going to make me carry all your stuff for you or something.
    0x08C3, // …
    0x08C7, // Don't be silly, Hicchan.
    0x08E0, // We've never walked to school together, Hicchan~.
    0x0911, // I almost want to ask why we would, but then it dawns on me. The both of them consider me their friend, like Misha said before. And they want to become better friends with me, even.
    0x09C6, // It's weird, I've never really thought about them that way. Or any of the people I've met so far this week. Is it really so easy?
    0x0A47, // Just like that…
    0x0A59, // Okay, let's go, then.
    0x0A6F, // Shizune grins craftily and puts her hands behind her back.
    0x0AAA, // Hahaha~! That's great, Hicchan~! Okay, okay, but first~! You had a really great idea, Shicchan liked it a lot… So~! it's time for a game!
    0x0B36, // Oh no.
    0x0B3D, // Shicchan is holding a 1000-yen note in one hand, Hicchan~! If you guess which one, you can have it! If you don't…
    0x0BB1, // You're carrying all our books to school~! Right, Shicchan~? Right~!
    0x0BF5, // She and Shizune exchange nods.
    0x0C14, // Okay, Hicchan~! Get ready~!
    0x0C30, // Carrying three bags instead of one, I think about the day that's ahead of me. Of us.
    0x0C85, // I can see students walking back and forth through the courtyard, probably in preparation of their own projects.
    0x0CF5, // The festival is practically here. That means there are only two possible reasons that my help is required.
    0x0D60, // Either there is only a small amount of work left, and they just want a helping hand to wrap up the mundane final checks they are obligated to do.
    0x0DF2, // Or there is a ton of work left, and Shizune is putting on a calm face as a torrent of built-up procrastinated work threatens to kill us all.
