    0x0068, // H… Hisao?
    0x0074, // Well, at least she remembers my name.
    0x009A, // Hey… I just wanted to apologize for yesterday.
    0x00CB, // I didn't mean to startle you or anything.
    0x00F5, // I'm just new here and thought I should get to know my classmates.
    0x0137, // As Hanako looks up at me, I notice her scarring once more.
    0x0172, // It's a little bewildering that you can barely notice it from across the room, but it's so noticeable from close up.
    0x01E6, // T… that's okay.
    0x01F8, // It… it was my fault.
    0x020F, // Nah, that wasn't anyone's 'fault,' it just kind of happened.
    0x024C, // So, are you waiting for someone? I saw you looking at the door before…
    0x0295, // Y-yes… Lilly.
    0x02A5, // Oh, you mean Lilly the blind girl?
    0x02C8, // Hanako only nods in response, and I can't help but wonder if defining people through their disabilities is a faux pas of the worst kind or just normal here.
    0x0365, // I guess that explains why Lilly took off after her yesterday.
    0x03A3, // She seems like a nice girl. Are you two friends?
    0x03D4, // Y-yes.
    0x03DB, // As if hoping for Lilly to appear, she checks over her shoulder again.
    0x0421, // I think I'm making her nervous again.
    0x0447, // I hope I'm not disturbing you right now…
    0x0472, // N-no, that's not it.
    0x0487, // It's just easier if Lilly doesn't come here…
    0x04B6, // Oh, because it's hard to get around the classroom?
    0x04E9, // Not… really.
    0x04F8, // Hanako's gaze drifts past my shoulder and towards Shizune.
    0x0533, // Shizune?
    0x053C, // Hanako nods again.
    0x054F, // What about her? Don't they get along?
    0x0575, // Hanako shakes her head. Clearly this is something she doesn't want to talk about.
    0x05C7, // It does make a strange sort of sense, Shizune and Lilly not getting along so well.
    0x061A, // Communication between the two would be all but impossible. It's hard enough talking to Shizune through Misha, even when you can see whose hands are 'talking.'
    0x06B9, // Hanako is so focused on Shizune that I am the first to notice Lilly at the door.
    0x070A, // Oh, she's here now.
    0x071E, // Hanako spins around to confirm this. Upon seeing Lilly, she moves quickly to the door.
    0x0775, // Lilly…
    0x077E, // Ah, Hanako. Good morning. Is the president here?
    0x07AF, // Y-yes.
    0x07B6, // Hanako glances over her shoulder at Shizune again, as if to confirm she can't hear them even though that's impossible.
    0x082D, // I suppose we'd best be off, then.
    0x084F, // Lilly's sigh and tone of what seems like frustration makes me raise an eyebrow. I guess there's some kind of enmity between the two.
    0x08D4, // It's intriguing, but that's not really something I'd ask about. I'm sure if they wanted me to know, then they would tell me.
    0x0951, // It's only my third day here; I should be trying to make friends, not finding out why people are enemies.
    0x09BA, // Still, it's a little funny to find out that this school has little feuds, just like my old high school.
    0x0A22, // Even if people are more tolerant of others, they're still going to get on each other's nerves.
    0x0A81, // Hey Lilly. How are things? I'm sorry I made you run off yesterday…
    0x0AC6, // Oh my, is that Hisao? I didn't realize you were here…
    0x0AFE, // It seems that Lilly is a little embarrassed about being so frank in front of me.
    0x0B4F, // S-sorry Lilly. I thought you realized…
    0x0B78, // No, it's all right, Hanako.
    0x0B94, // Hisao, please don't worry about yesterday. It was just a misunderstanding.
    0x0BDF, // If… you say so. I'm still working this place out.
    0x0C13, // Well then, I think you'll find most people here a lot more forgiving than elsewhere.
    0x0C68, // If you are feeling a little confused, please don't be afraid to ask questions.
    0x0CB7, // Sure, I'll remember that.
    0x0CD1, // Um… Lilly…
    0x0CE0, // Lilly gives a small nod of acknowledgment.
    0x0D0B, // I'm sorry Hisao, but we must be off.
    0x0D30, // Hanako really doesn't look all that comfortable here right now, and Lilly still seems a little embarrassed.
    0x0D9C, // I wonder if my apologies really made any impact.
    0x0DCD, // Mind if I accompany you two?
    0x0DEA, // I know I'm kinda pushing it, but… Lilly hmms quietly, still smiling.
    0x0E31, // I'm sure that we could accommodate you, can't we, Hanako?
    0x0E6B, // She looks at Lilly, then at me, and then she freezes, wide-eyed.
    0x0EAC, // S… sure.
    0x0EB7, // Well then, shall we go?
    0x0ECF, // I'm sure Lilly wouldn't do this so easily if she saw how scared Hanako looks, but it can't be helped now.
    0x0F39, // Declining after the deal is sealed would only cause confusion and problems.
