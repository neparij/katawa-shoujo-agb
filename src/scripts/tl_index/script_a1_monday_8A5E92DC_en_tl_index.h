    0x0000, // It's been four months since my heart attack.
    0x002D, // {vspace=60}In that whole time, I can probably count the times I've left this hospital room unsupervised on one hand.
    0x00A2, // Four months is a pretty long time when you're left alone with your thoughts. So, I've had plenty of time to come to terms with my situation.
    0x012F, // Arrhythmia.
    0x013B, // A strange word. A foreign, alien one. One that you don't want to be in the same room with.
    0x0196, // A rare condition. It causes the heart to act erratically and occasionally beat way too fast. It can be fatal.
    0x0204, // Apparently, I've had it for a long time. They said it was a miracle that I was able to go on so long without anything happening.
    0x0285, // Is that really a miracle? I guess it was supposed to make me feel better, more appreciative of my life.
    0x02ED, // It really didn't do anything to cheer me up.
    0x031A, // {vspace=150}My parents, I think, were hit harder by the news than I was. They practically had two hemorrhages apiece.
    0x0390, // {vspace=30}I had already had a full day by then to digest everything. To them, it was all fresh. They were even willing to sell our house in order to pay for a cure.
    0x0436, // {vspace=60}Of course there isn't a cure.
    0x045F, // {vspace=30}Because of the late discovery of this… condition, I've had to stay at the hospital, to recuperate from the treatments.
    0x04E3, // When I was first admitted, it felt as if I was missed…
    0x051C, // For about a week, my room in the ward was full of flowers, balloons and cards.
    0x056B, // But, the visitors soon dwindled and all the get-well gifts began trickling down to nothing shortly after.
    0x05D5, // I realized that the only reason I had gotten so many cards and flowers was because sending me their sympathy had been turned into a class project.
    0x0668, // Maybe some people were genuinely concerned, but I doubt it. Even in the beginning, I barely had visitors. By the end of the first month, only my parents came by on a regular basis.
    0x071D, // Iwanako was the last to stop visiting.
    0x0744, // After six weeks, I never saw her again. We never had that much to talk about when she visited, anyway.
    0x07AB, // We didn't touch the subject that was between us on that snowy day ever again.
    0x07F9, // {vspace=30}The hospital?
    0x0812, // It's not really a place I'd like to live in.
    0x083F, // The doctors and nurses feel so impersonal and faceless.
    0x0877, // I guess it's because they are in a hurry and they have a million other patients waiting for them, but it makes me feel uncomfortable.
    0x08FD, // For the first month or so, I asked the head cardiologist every time I saw him for a rough estimate of when I'd be able to leave.
    0x097E, // He never answered anything in a straightforward way, but told me to wait and see if the treatment and surgeries worked.
    0x09F6, // {vspace=30}So, I idly observed the scar that those surgeries had left on my chest slowly change its appearance over time, thinking of it as some kind of an omen.
    0x0A98, // I still ask the head cardiologist about leaving, but my expectations are low enough now that I'm not disappointed any more when I don't get a reply. The way he shuffles around the answer shows that there is at least some hope.
    0x0B7B, // {vspace=120}At some point I stopped watching TV. I don't know why, I just did.
    0x0BCA, // Maybe it was the wrong kind of escapism for my situation.
    0x0C04, // {vspace=30}I started reading instead. There was a small 'library' at the hospital, although it was more like a storeroom for books. I began working my way through it, one small stack at a time. After consuming them, I would go back for more.
    0x0CF6, // I found that I liked reading and I think I even became a bit addicted. I started feeling naked without a book in my hands.
    0x0D71, // {vspace=30}But I loved the stories.
    0x0D95, // {vspace=30}That was what my life was like.
    0x0DC0, // {vspace=30}The days became increasingly harder to distinguish from each other, differing only by the book I was reading and the weather outside. It felt like time blurred into some kind of gooey mass I was trapped inside, instead of moving within.
    0x0EB8, // A week could go by without me really noticing it.
    0x0EEA, // Sometimes, I'd pause in realization that I didn't know what day of the week it was.
    0x0F3E, // But other times, all the things that surrounded me would painfully crash into my consciousness, through the barrier of nonchalance I had set up for myself.
    0x0FDA, // The pages of my book would start to feel sharp and burning hot and the heaviness in my chest would become so hard to bear that I had to put the book aside and just lay down for a while, looking at the ceiling as if I was going to cry.
    0x10C5, // But that happened only rarely.
    0x10E4, // {vspace=30}And I couldn't even cry.
    0x1108, // Today, the doctor comes in and gives me a smile. He seems excited, but not very. It's like he is trying to make an effort to be happy on my behalf.
    0x119C, // My parents are here. It's been a few days since I've last seen them. Both of them are even sort of dressed up. Is this supposed to be some kind of special occasion? It's not a party.
    0x1253, // There is this ritual the head cardiologist has. He takes his time, sorting his papers, then setting them aside as if to make a point of the pointlessness of what he just did.
    0x1302, // Then he casually sits down on the edge of the bed next to mine. He looks me in the eyes for a moment.
    0x1368, // Hello, Hisao. How are you today?
    0x1389, // I don't answer him but I smile a little, back at him.
    0x13BF, // I believe that you can go home; your heart is stronger now, and with some precautions, you should be fine.
    0x142A, // We have all your medication sorted out. I'll give your father the prescription.
    0x147A, // The doctor hands a sheet of paper to my dad, whose expression turns wooden as he reads it quickly.
    0x14DD, // So many…
    0x14E8, // I take it from his hand and take a look myself, feeling numb. How am I supposed to react to this?
    0x154A, // The absurdly long list of medications staring back at me from the paper seems insurmountable. They all blend together in a sea of letters.
    0x15D5, // This is insane.
    0x15E5, // Side effects, adverse effects, contraindications and dosages are listed line after line with cold precision.
    0x1652, // I try to read them, but it's so futile.
    0x167A, // I can't understand any of it. Attempting to only makes me feel sicker.
    0x16C1, // All this… for the rest of my life, every day?
    0x16F1, // I'm afraid that is the best we can do at this point.
    0x1726, // However, new medications are always being developed, so I wouldn't be surprised to see that list fade over the years.
    0x179C, // Years… What kind of confidence booster is that? I'd have felt better if he hadn't said anything at all…
    0x1808, // Also, I've spoken with your parents and we believe that it would be best if you don't return to your old school.
    0x1879, // What!?
    0x1880, // Please, calm down, Hisao. Listen to what the doctor has to say…
    0x18C2, // Calm down? The way he says it tells me he knew full well that I wouldn't like it. Am I going to be home schooled?
    0x1934, // Whatever of my concern shows, it's ignored.
    0x1960, // We all understand that your education is paramount; however, I don't think that it's wise for you to be without supervision.
    0x19DD, // At least not until we're sure that your medication is suitable.
    0x1A1D, // So, I've spoken to your parents about a transfer.
    0x1A4F, // It's a school called Yamaku Academy that specializes in dealing with disabled students.
    0x1AA7, // Disabled? What? Am I…
    0x1ABF, // It has a 24-hour nursing staff and it's only a few minutes from a highly regarded general hospital. The majority of students live on the campus.
    0x1B50, // Think of it as a boarding school of sorts. It's designed to give students a degree of independence, while keeping help nearby.
    0x1BCF, // Independence? It's a school for disabled kids. Don't try to disguise that fact.
    0x1C1F, // If it was really that 'free,' there wouldn't be a 24-hour nursing staff, and you wouldn't make a hospital being nearby a selling point.
    0x1CA7, // Of course, that's only if you want to go. But… your mother and I aren't really able to home school you.
    0x1D11, // We went out there and had a look a couple of weeks back; I think you'd like it.
    0x1D61, // It looks like I really don't have a choice.
    0x1D8D, // Compared to other heart problems, people with your condition usually tend to live long lives. You'll need a job one day and this is a good opportunity to continue your education.
    0x1E40, // This isn't an opportunity, don't call it an opportunity. Don't call it a goddamned opportunity.
    0x1EA0, // Well, you should be excited at the chance to go back to school. I remember you wanted to return to school, and while it's not the same one…
    0x1F2E, // A special school. That's…
    0x1F4A, // An insult. That is what I want to say. It's a step down.
    0x1F83, // It's not what you think. All of the students there are pretty active, in their own sort of way.
    0x1FE3, // It's geared towards students that can still get around and learn, but just need a little help… in one way or another.
    0x205B, // Your father's right. And many of the graduates of the school have gone on to do amazing things. A person doesn't have to be held back by their disability.
    0x20F6, // One of my colleagues in another hospital is a graduate.
    0x212E, // I don't care. A person doesn't have to be held back by their disability? That's what a disability is.
    0x2194, // I really hate that something so important was decided for me. But what can I do about it? A 'normal' life is out of the question now.
    0x221A, // It's funny, I had always thought my life was actually kind of boring, but now I miss it.
    0x2273, // I want to protest. I want to blame this lack of reaction on shock, or fatigue. I could easily yell out something now - something about how I can go back to school anyway. But, no.
    0x2327, // I don't say anything. The fact is that I know now it's futile.
    0x2366, // I look around the room, feeling very tired of all this. The hospital, doctors, my condition, everything. I don't see anything that would make me feel any different.
    0x240B, // There really isn't a choice. I know this, but the thought of going to a disabled school… what are those even like? As much as I try to put a positive spin on this, it's very difficult.
    0x24C6, // But let me try.
    0x24D6, // A clean slate isn't a bad thing.
    0x24F7, // That is all I can think of to get me through this. At least I still have something; even if it's a 'special school,' it's something. It's a fresh start, and my life isn't over. It would be a mistake to just resign myself to thinking that.
    0x25E6, // At the very least, I'll try to see what my new life will look like.
