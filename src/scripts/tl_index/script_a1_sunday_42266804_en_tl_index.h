    0x0000, // After buying a plastic plate of takoyaki from a stall belonging to the class next to ours, I take a seat in the school gardens and watch people pass as I tentatively nibble away at the rather bland-tasting item.
    0x00D4, // I guess I shouldn't complain. It's better than nothing and didn't cost much.
    0x0121, // As I look out towards the school, watching the people coming and going proves a surprisingly entertaining way of passing the time as I eat.
    0x01AD, // Little children accompanied by parents or grandparents scamper about in the din from event to event; one hand dragging their company and the other bearing an oversized, colorful snack.
    0x0266, // I can't help but notice the age range among the people here is skewed towards the elderly, something that I'd also noticed when I was walking around town.
    0x0301, // This must be one of those towns where the only people left are those that lived here their whole lives and ardently refuse to leave, and those wanting to live out the rest of their days in one of the increasingly few tranquil places.
    0x03EB, // I guess that also goes a way to explaining how conservative Yamaku's school culture seems to be.
    0x044C, // Not that I mind one bit. I kind of like how calm Yamaku and its surroundings are.
    0x049E, // The heat, though, is another matter entirely. Sitting in one place for so long has focused my mind on how annoyingly humid it's getting, now that the hottest part of the day is here.
    0x0555, // I'd better get moving if I—{w=.5}{nw}
    0x057D, // Gah!
    0x0582, // The sound of the carillon bells takes me completely by surprise as I stand up, a reaction shared by a few of the people strolling around as well.
    0x0614, // The PA system crackles to life after the tolling bells end. Its age shows as the principal makes a barely intelligible announcement over it, officially opening the festival that's very much in full swing.
    0x06E1, // It's quite amusing to contrast the pleasant smiles of the older folk against the alternatively pained and bored grimaces of their younger charges. The students, on the other hand, seem to pay it little heed.
    0x07B1, // Nevertheless, as the address finally ends, all are united in polite - if not overly enthusiastic - applause, and then get back to business.
    0x083D, // Slipping a hand in my pocket to look as relaxed as possible, I casually glance around for something to do.
    0x08A8, // …It's somewhat difficult to see very far with all the people around.
    0x08EF, // I decide to fall back on a tried and trusted rule: go where everyone else seems to be gathering. Right now, that's the school courtyard and surroundings.
    0x0989, // Throwing the used plate into a trash can, I make my way towards the school building.
    0x09DE, // Seeing the number of stalls around the perimeter of the school building surprises me. Quite a few of the classes must have opted to have multiple stalls.
    0x0A78, // In deciding which to visit first, I catch sight of a familiar banner with a blue patterned border and red text.
    0x0AE8, // Lilly's stall is as good a place to start as any. I'm curious as to how it's going, after all of the work she and her class have been doing for it.
    0x0B7C, // Stepping up to it, I begin to see why the class took so long to organize everything.
    0x0BD1, // Easily twice as wide as many of the other stalls and with equipment for cooking strewn everywhere, it's closer to an outdoor restaurant than a festival event.
    0x0C70, // As a student in front of me takes a bowl of noodles and leaves, I walk up to the counter.
    0x0CCA, // The girl behind it seems quite exasperated, and asks me to wait a moment before she disappears underneath the counter.
    0x0D41, // Seizing the moment, I take a quick glance around.
    0x0D73, // Steam seems to be rising from everywhere, as pots and pans simmer away. The most blind of the students are unpacking ingredients while being helped by someone who is probably the teacher of 3-2.
    0x0E36, // It doesn't take long to notice Lilly among them, talking with the teacher as she quickly counts out the boxes and packets with her fingers.
    0x0EC2, // From her expression and the fact that both she and the teacher seem to be in a state of mild confusion, it appears that there's been some problem in coordination.
    0x0F65, // Before I can stare any longer, the girl behind the counter pops up again, only to look back and ask where the spare change box is.
    0x0FE8, // Lilly pauses for a moment, before she and the girl switch places at the counter and the teacher quickly walks off somewhere.
    0x1065, // Sorry about that, we're having a few problems. What would you like?
    0x10A9, // It takes me a second to remember what I'd come here for. My eyes quickly dart to the side to read the menu sitting on the counter.
    0x112C, // Oh, uh, I guess some… miso soup?
    0x114F, // Ah, is that Hisao?
    0x1162, // Yep. Looks like you're pretty busy.
    0x1186, // Her face all but confirms it as she drops her waitress facade.
    0x11C5, // Somewhere along the line, our order got mixed up. We're trying to fix it now, but it looks like we only have half of what we needed.
    0x124A, // Wouldn't serving smaller portions cover over the problem?
    0x1284, // It seems like that's what we'll have to do, though I wish we didn't. The fact that a good half of our class is gone doesn't help, either.
    0x130E, // I glance behind her to see how many people are actually operating the stall.
    0x135B, // It couldn't be over about eight.
    0x137C, // I take it that's why your teacher left?
    0x13A4, // That's right. She's going to try and round up a few more of our classmates to help.
    0x13F8, // Hearing the sound of footsteps behind me, I stealthily glance backwards to see an elderly couple taking a place in the line. I guess I'd better stop loitering around and chatting.
    0x14AC, // Here's the money for the soup.
    0x14CB, // Soup… oh, right, coming right up.
    0x14EF, // Lilly turns and calls for a bowl of miso soup as I hand over the money for it.
    0x153E, // Taking the coins in her palm, I can't help but notice how efficiently she counts them out with her long, pale fingers. Eventually satisfied that I've handed over correct change, she puts it into a small metal tray.
    0x1615, // It isn't long before the soup is made and carefully handed to her, after which she turns and subsequently passes it to me.
    0x1690, // Thanks. I'll come back to drop off the bowl.
    0x16BD, // Thank you, Hisao. Oh, there is one other thing. Have you seen Hanako?
    0x1703, // Hanako… no, not today. Why?
    0x1721, // She gives a small sigh of abject disappointment.
    0x1752, // It's okay. I was just wondering what she was doing for the festival.
    0x1797, // You'll come back when you're done, then?
    0x17C0, // Sure. I'll keep an eye out for Hanako, too.
    0x17EC, // Thank you, Hisao.
    0x17FE, // I walk off from the stall and find a seat, carefully cradling the steaming wooden bowl in both hands.
    0x1864, // Compared to the dumplings from before, this is quite nice. A little cool compared to what it probably should be, perhaps, but the flavor is enough to cover for that reasonably well.
    0x191A, // As I drink, I can't help but feel somewhat guilty for not being as involved in the festival as the others.
    0x1985, // It can't really be helped, considering I was dropped into the school only a week ago, but it still weighs heavily on my mind.
    0x1A03, // That, and the fact that a few students don't really seem to be enjoying the festival as much as the visitors.
    0x1A71, // Eventually I finish my bowl and leave for the stall, to drop it off.
    0x1AB6, // Considering that there seems to be no line at all, I take my time walking up.
    0x1B04, // It seems the teacher's mission paid off: there are now over a dozen students helping, and much of the unpacking has been done.
    0x1B83, // Despite most of them seeming quite relaxed as they work, Lilly still appears to be somewhat stressed.
