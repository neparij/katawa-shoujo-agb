    0x0075, // Dunno if I should steer clear of the takoyaki, or head straight in.
    0x00B9, // Deal? Sounds ominous. So what are you getting in return?
    0x00F2, // Nothing, I guess? It's not that kind of a deal.
    0x0122, // You know Emi, from our year? We kinda agreed to watch each other's backs and…
    0x0172, // Aieeeeeeee!
    0x017E, // The shrill scream and the expression of abject terror in Kenji's face chill my blood. It's as if I told a Catholic priest I sold my soul to the devil.
    0x0215, // Her! You sold your soul to the devil, and didn't get anything in return?
    0x025E, // What the hell is wrong with you, man?
    0x0284, // Do you know who you are dealing with?
    0x02AA, // She's a public health danger. Do you know how many people she sends to the hospital monthly with her carefully placed flying tackles?
    0x0330, // She's one of them! A key player in the vast conspiracy that aims for the complete submission of everything that is manly.
    0x03AA, // I can't believe what I'm hearing. I trusted in your judgment, man. I thought we were brothers.
    0x0409, // You have to call it off before it's too late.
    0x0437, // This festival too; it's just one of their ploys.
    0x0468, // It's kinda unsettling, and now I start to feel doubtful, myself.
    0x04A9, // Should I bother going?
    0x04C0, // I've got a book I've been meaning to read.
    0x04EB, // Something about an underground postal system that may or may not exist.
    0x0533, // It's short, too. I could have it finished in a day.
    0x0567, // But would that be a good way to spend my time?
    0x0596, // Well, yeah. It definitely would be.
    0x05BA, // But I suppose that it would probably be a better idea to head outside.
    0x0601, // See the festival.
    0x0613, // Try to integrate with all the other sideshow acts.
    0x0646, // Honestly, I should at least make an attempt to keep up the somewhat friendly personality I've had the past week.
    0x06B7, // Maybe get something to eat, my stomach suggests.
    0x06E8, // It's almost lunchtime… I could at least grab something from one of the stalls outside.
    0x0741, // I'm soon outside, surrounded by various students and people who may or may not be their parents.
    0x07A2, // Every so often I catch a glimpse of someone who clearly just came up from town for the promise of a festival.
    0x0810, // They're easy to spot.
    0x0826, // The ones who can't stop staring, and behind their eyes you can tell they're thinking 'Now, what's wrong with {b}this{/b} one?'
    0x08A5, // I almost want to yell at them.
    0x08C4, // But at the same time, can I deny that I've been doing the same thing all week?
    0x0913, // A wave of something like disgust sweeps over me; guilt for my own narrow-mindedness.
    0x0968, // …
    0x096C, // I push the thoughts aside, concentrating on the pangs of hunger that burn my guts like a wildfire.
    0x09CF, // The scent of something fried leads me to the promised land, where I can get some lunch.
    0x0A27, // I'm just getting my order when a loud voice interrupts me.
    0x0A62, // Hey, what the hell are you doing?
    0x0A84, // Having break— er, lunch.
    0x0A9F, // Breakfast?
    0x0AAA, // You mean you just got up?
    0x0AC4, // Er…
    0x0ACA, // Suddenly sleeping all morning feels like a crime.
    0x0AFC, // No, I meant lunch… honest.
    0x0B19, // She's not buying it.
    0x0B2E, // Brunch?
    0x0B36, // That's not a healthy breakfast at all!
    0x0B5D, // She snatches my food out of my hand and glares at me.
    0x0B93, // What the hell is this girl doing?
    0x0BB5, // Hey, that's my breakfast!
    0x0BCF, // What happened to it being your lunch?
    0x0BF5, // That's my… whatever, it's my food!
    0x0C1A, // Emi places her hands on her hips and begins lecturing me.
    0x0C54, // Did you really forget your dietary plan already?
    0x0C85, // You need to be more conscious of your health, Hisao!
    0x0CBA, // What about your heart?
    0x0CD1, // My heart's fine the way it is! Mostly.
    0x0CF8, // All I get in response is a roll of the eyes.
    0x0D25, // I doubt that.
    0x0D33, // You wouldn't be here if that was the case, would you?
    0x0D69, // The girl's got a point, of course.
    0x0D8C, // But I'm not about to concede it.
    0x0DAD, // It's not that bad of a heart!
    0x0DCB, // Certainly it can handle a little grease now and again!
    0x0E02, // Yeah, sure. And it handled a little running just fine, too.
    0x0E3E, // Emi seems unconvinced.
    0x0E55, // Not surprising, as I haven't even managed to convince myself.
    0x0E93, // Maybe, but not if you're sleeping the day away all the time!
    0x0ED0, // A devious look suddenly crosses her face.
    0x0EFA, // Of course, if you'd been following a routine from the beginning you wouldn't be in this situation…
    0x0F5F, // Hey, I've had a pretty eventful week, you know!
    0x0F8F, // For example, I almost died! And there was a lot of meeting people, and then I was on a roof for a while…
    0x0FFA, // Which is no excuse for slacking off, you know.
    0x1029, // A little near death experience is no excuse for skipping basic exercise.
    0x1072, // Like running in the mornings.
    0x1090, // She nods, as if something important has just been decided.
    0x10CB, // So it's settled, then!
    0x10E2, // You've seen the error of your ways and are willing to adhere to my routine, right?
    0x1135, // I'll see you bright and early in the morning?
    0x1163, // We'll be running buddies?
    0x117D, // You know, you'd already convinced me yesterday that this was a good idea.
    0x11C7, // You don't need to convince me again.
    0x11EC, // Not that I did a good job of being convinced.
    0x121A, // She's right about eating healthy, after all. And here I am ordering up something grossly unhealthy.
    0x127E, // But delicious!
    0x128D, // There are more important things than deliciousness, aren't there?
    0x12CF, // Like staying alive?
    0x12E3, // If Emi weren't here browbeating me for my poor decisions, I'd probably…
    0x132D, // Hey, wait a second.
    0x1341, // A sudden question springs to mind.
    0x1364, // Hey, why the hell have you taken such an interest in my well-being?
    0x13A8, // Emi shrugs and grins at me.
    0x13C4, // You're the new guy.
    0x13D8, // I figure you don't have any friends yet, right?
    0x1408, // Besides, I've caused you trouble all week, right?
    0x143A, // I owe you for not getting angry.
    0x145B, // And I told the nurse I would, anyway.
    0x1481, // Uh… huh. Crazy little running girl wants to make me healthy.
    0x14C0, // Well, I suppose there are worse fates.
    0x14E7, // Okay, that sounds… fine.
    0x1502, // Thanks for your concern.
    0x151B, // Tomorrow morning, then?
    0x1533, // I figure that ends the conversation, so I turn to leave.
    0x156C, // Not so fast!
    0x1579, // I feel a hand on my collar and in a second I've been yanked backwards.
    0x15C0, // Hey, no need to be so rough!
    0x15DD, // What do you want now?
    0x15F3, // Emi looks almost wounded by my annoyed question.
    0x1624, // Thought you could use the company.
    0x1647, // Her eyes narrow.
    0x1658, // Besides, you were just going to try sneaking some more of that fried crap, weren't you?
    0x16B0, // Well, I wasn't going to, but now that she mentions it that would have been a really good idea.
    0x170F, // I was not!
    0x171A, // Another glare.
    0x1729, // Okay, maybe I was going to get a little…
    0x1754, // The glare continues.
    0x1769, // Okay, a lot.
    0x1776, // Jesus, I'm a danger to myself and others, aren't I?
    0x17AA, // I get done agreeing that I need to be healthier, and then immediately start considering the next unhealthy habit that comes my way.
    0x182E, // I knew it! You can't be trusted.
    0x184F, // Now I definitely have to stick with you.
    0x1878, // This whole situation feels silly.
    0x189A, // I can only imagine what passersby think of the sight of me being lectured by a tiny girl half my size.
    0x1901, // Maybe I should just give up for now.
    0x1926, // Fine, do what you like.
    0x193E, // I sigh.
    0x1946, // Might as well make the best of this.
    0x196B, // What do you want to do?
    0x1983, // Emi thinks for a minute.
    0x199C, // Well, I promised Rin I'd stop by her mural…
    0x19CA, // So let's do that!
    0x19DC, // I confess I'm slightly curious as to how her mural turned out myself, so again I consider there are worse fates.
    0x1A4D, // I give a nod of assent and find myself almost dragged bodily through the crowd as Emi races to our destination.
    0x1ABD, // By the time we reach the dorms, I can feel my heart pounding.
    0x1AFB, // My heart shouldn't be pounding after just that.
    0x1B2B, // I take a few deep breaths, willing myself to calm down.
    0x1B63, // I'm one of the most normal looking people in the school, but I still have to be here.
    0x1BB9, // Sometimes I almost wish I'd lost a hand or something.
    0x1BEF, // At least then it'd be obvious that I belong.
    0x1C1C, // But instead I don't even look sick.
    0x1C40, // Even now, trying to catch my breath, I just look out of shape.
    0x1C7F, // Emi looks back and notices my state of distress.
    0x1CB0, // You're not going to die on me, are you?
    0x1CD8, // Please don't!
    0x1CE6, // It'll be all my fault, and I don't want to deal with that kind of guilt.
    0x1D2F, // Besides, after the last time I really don't think I need to see that again, especially because the nurse will totally say it's all my fault.
    0x1DBC, // N… nah, I'm fine.
    0x1DD0, // Guess I need to start running after all.
    0x1DF9, // And you wanted to keep eating your greasy… whatever it was.
    0x1E37, // See? It's a good thing I found you, right?
    0x1E62, // Yes it was.
    0x1E6E, // Maybe.
    0x1E75, // Of course I don't add that I wouldn't be in this state if she hadn't dragged me across the festival grounds.
    0x1EE2, // Further conversation is interrupted by the sudden appearance of Rin.
    0x1F27, // Oh, it's you.
    0x1F35, // Hello Emi.
    0x1F40, // Hey Rin! I brought Hisao along because he was going to give himself a heart attack!
    0x1F94, // I was not!
    0x1F9F, // My objection goes unnoticed.
    0x1FBC, // We stopped by to see how the mural turned out!
    0x1FEB, // Rin nods slowly.
    0x1FFC, // Well, it's right there.
    0x2014, // You can see it pretty clearly.
    0x2033, // I find myself wondering how long Rin's been standing here in front of the mural.
    0x2084, // Has anyone even stopped by to look at it?
    0x20AE, // Are we the first ones?
    0x20C5, // Obviously we're not the first to see it, of course.
    0x20F9, // I mean, it's pretty big.
    0x2112, // You'd be hard-pressed not to see it.
    0x2137, // At the same time, I don't think anyone's actually talked to Rin about it.
    0x2181, // Anyone but us, that is.
    0x2199, // I feel compelled to say something.
    0x21BC, // It looks pretty good.
    0x21D2, // I'm still not happy with how it turned out.
    0x21FE, // But I guess it'll do.
    0x2214, // She seems almost resigned to it.
    0x2235, // I'm not sure what she expected as a result, but I guess she didn't quite get there.
    0x2289, // We stand in front of the mural, taking it all in.
    0x22BB, // I try my best to concentrate on the composition of the thing.
    0x22F9, // It's actually fairly interesting.
    0x231B, // The colors swoop and blend together, dragging me along with them.
    0x235D, // There's a dreamlike quality to the whole thing that makes me almost feel sleepy.
    0x23AE, // I try hunting out some of the colors Emi and I grabbed for her.
    0x23EE, // Try as I might, I can't see any Prussian Blue.
    0x241D, // Oh well.
    0x2426, // I'm sure it's in there somewhere.
    0x2448, // My feet start to hurt, but Rin doesn't seem inclined to move on.
    0x2489, // Emi speaks up.
    0x2498, // Hey Rin, have you eaten?
    0x24B1, // Of course. You can't survive otherwise.
    0x24D9, // What about in the past five hours?
    0x24FC, // Maybe. But I'm hungry again, so maybe that means I'm wrong.
    0x2538, // Emi grins and claps her hands together.
    0x2560, // Good! Come get some food with us!
    0x2582, // Rin nods in assent.
    0x2596, // Okay, but we should hurry before they notice I'm gone.
    0x25CD, // Somehow I don't think they'd care.
    0x25F0, // Whoever they are.
    0x2602, // As we head back to the food stalls, I cast a longing eye over the fried food.
    0x2650, // No, I'd better not.
    0x2664, // I'm pretty sure Emi wouldn't let me, anyway.
    0x2691, // We find a nice spot on the grass and sit down to eat our purchases.
    0x26D5, // Well, my purchases, anyway. Somehow I've wound up paying for all the food.
    0x2720, // Surprisingly, my (unfried) food is pretty good.
    0x2750, // Silence falls as Emi and I eat and Rin stares at… something or other, occasionally eating a bite or two of her food.
    0x27C7, // I finish my meal first, and lay back on the grass.
    0x27FA, // Emi glances up from her food.
    0x2818, // Tired, Hisao?
    0x2826, // A little, I guess.
    0x2839, // Well, don't oversleep or anything tomorrow morning.
    0x286D, // We start our morning runs, remember?
    0x2892, // Actually, they'd slipped my mind.
    0x28B4, // I was actually just enjoying myself.
    0x28D9, // Wandering around the festival with these two has actually been fun.
    0x291D, // Yeah, I'll set an alarm.
    0x2936, // You'd better be there!
    0x294D, // I'll get angry if you aren't!
    0x296B, // God forbid.
    0x2977, // I don't think God comes into it.
    0x2998, // Unless there's some kind of freak accident and your alarm clock shorts out.
    0x29E4, // That might be a random act of God.
    0x2A07, // Well don't cause any random acts of God, then.
    0x2A36, // A plan forms itself in my mind.
    0x2A56, // It's a plan that makes me feel kind of guilty, but I throw it into execution anyway.
    0x2AAB, // Dammit, I've earned a little fried food.
    0x2AD4, // And anyway, I'm going to start running tomorrow, right?
    0x2B0C, // So the actual routine all starts then, not now.
    0x2B3C, // Ergo, the dietary portion starts tomorrow too, ergo I can have something unhealthy today.
    0x2B96, // A sort of final farewell to all the stuff I used to eat with wild abandon before the hospital.
    0x2BF5, // Actually, I suppose I should head back to my room.
    0x2C28, // I had some homework to do, and if I'm going to run in the morning I should make it an early night…
    0x2C8D, // Those narrowed eyes again.
    0x2CA8, // You sure you're not just going to sneak off and buy some of that fried stuff over there?
    0x2D01, // Nah, I'm too full to bother now.
    0x2D22, // I pat my stomach for emphasis.
    0x2D41, // Besides, you two have cleaned me out anyway.
    0x2D6E, // Emi giggles. It's a surprisingly pleasant sound.
    0x2D9F, // Another pang of guilt.
    0x2DB6, // She's got to know that I'm lying to her, doesn't she?
    0x2DEC, // Or is she just that trusting?
    0x2E0A, // I feel kind of like a monster.
    0x2E29, // All part of my master plan, Hisao.
    0x2E4C, // Well, I guess I'll see you tomorrow morning then.
    0x2E7E, // Thanks for the food! And for keeping us company!
    0x2EAF, // And here I thought she was doing me a favor.
    0x2EDC, // Rin nods in agreement.
    0x2EF3, // I won't say 'See you tomorrow' because that would be like predicting the future, and I'm pretty sure I can't do that.
    0x2F69, // …
    0x2F6D, // Okay.
    0x2F73, // Bye, you two.
    0x2F81, // I feel oddly glad that I decided to leave my room today.
    0x2FBA, // Not a bad way to start my second week here, I suppose.
    0x2FF1, // Once I'm sure I'm out of Emi's line of sight, I make a beeline for the food stands and buy some cake.
    0x3057, // At least it's not fried, right?
    0x3077, // That's slightly better than what I was planning to do.
    0x30AE, // I still feel a little bad about lying to Emi, though.
    0x30E4, // She really does seem concerned about my health.
    0x3114, // I'll make it up to her somehow.
    0x3134, // Better head back to my room.
    0x3151, // Hey, I {b}do{/b} have work to do.
    0x3173, // My book waits for me, and I flop on to my bed and read through the fireworks display.
    0x31C9, // Eventually all the walking around (or more accurately, running around) catches up with me.
    0x3224, // I really am out of shape.
    0x323E, // Emi dragging me out in the morning to run might just be a good thing after all.
    0x328E, // It's something to look forward to.
