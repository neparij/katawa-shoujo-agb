    0x0078, // …
    0x007C, // …Ah, that's right. I think Lilly mentioned something about going into town today before Rin bumped into us.
    0x00EA, // The thought of that walk makes me look outside.
    0x011A, // The bright sun and occasional people wandering around and enjoying the afternoon make me yearn to get out of school, or at least do something other than sit here.
    0x01BD, // Giving in to one of my worst vices, procrastination, I decide that history is a subject best studied on a Sunday. Or a Monday. Or on any day other than this one.
    0x025F, // I give a grunt as I lever myself out of my seat, briefly debating with myself whether or not to hang out with Kenji.
    0x02D4, // He doesn't strike me as the 'enjoying the nice weather outside with others' kind of person, really. I guess I'll catch up with him later.
    0x035E, // Changing tacks, I briefly entertain the idea of talking with Hanako, but by the time I look at her seat, it's vacant. She must've left for the library.
    0x03F6, // Go for a walk into town.
    0x040F, // Go to the library.
    0x0422, // Yu… Yuuko?
    0x042F, // Hi, I had no idea you worked here.
    0x0452, // Ah, yes, um…
    0x0461, // Welcome to the Shanghai! May I take your order?
    0x0491, // I don't know… well, some coffee, please?
    0x04BC, // Yes, certainly. I'll make it right away and bring it to you when it's done.
    0x0508, // Uh, thanks.
    0x0514, // Hi, Lilly.
    0x051F, // …Hisao?
    0x0529, // Yeah. Nice to see you again.
    0x0546, // Know each other?
    0x0557, // I… guess.
    0x0563, // Hmm… care to take a seat?
    0x057F, // I suppose some introductions might be in order.
    0x05AF, // Hisao, this is Akira Satou, my older sister. Akira, this is Hisao Nakai, another Yamaku student.
    0x0610, // So, how's school recently?
    0x062B, // Sounds like it's pretty busy for ya, then.
    0x0656, // At least I'm not cooking your meals after school any more.
    0x0691, // Whoa, so cold. Weren't ya just cooking for yourself anyway? I only ever got leftovers.
    0x06E8, // That's not the point… are you managing to feed yourself, at least?
    0x072D, // I can cook without blowing myself up, you know.
    0x075D, // Mostly.
    0x0765, // That's…
    0x076F, // Hahaha! It's fine, it's fine. I needed to learn sometime anyway.
    0x07B0, // Ah, Lilly?
    0x07BB, // Well, I'd better be off. It was nice talking to ya, Lilly.
    0x07F6, // Akira, do you have to…?
    0x0810, // Sorry, I need to get back to work. They'll be on my neck again if I don't make it back quickly.
    0x0870, // Bye, Akira…
    0x087E, // C'mon, don't look so down. I'll be around again soon. Seeyas.
    0x08BC, // She seems nice.
    0x08CC, // We used to live together, but now that I live at school we hardly ever see each other.
    0x0923, // You used to live together? Was it somewhere around here?
    0x095C, // It was pretty far south, so the trip into Yamaku was fairly long.
    0x099E, // With her working hours getting longer and Yamaku being so far away, there was little choice in the end but to move into the dormitories.
    0x0A27, // I take it you're better rested, now?
    0x0A4C, // Sorry?
    0x0A53, // You sound less exhausted than you did when you first came in.
    0x0A91, // Yeah. Ended up walking all over town, despite only planning on taking a short walk down here.
    0x0AEF, // You're leaving?
    0x0AFF, // Yeah. You going to head back as well? It's getting kind of late.
    0x0B40, // Yuuko, could we have one more coffee please?
    0x0B6D, // Okay, I'll bring it right away!
    0x0B8D, // That's… not subtle.
    0x0BA3, // Wanting company, then?
    0x0BBA, // Hmm… I'd say that it's more that I was wondering…
    0x0BF0, // Do you have any siblings?
    0x0C0A, // No, only child. To be honest, the idea of having someone that close makes me a bit envious.
    0x0C66, // Interesting…
    0x0C75, // It's just that others have said the same thing before.
    0x0CAC, // It's a difficult subject to try and think about objectively, given that I've always had someone like that.
