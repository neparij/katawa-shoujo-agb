    0x0059, // The second lap's done quickly, and without even considering it I keep going.
    0x00A6, // Emi looks back over her shoulder at me and grins.
    0x00D8, // Still going?
    0x00E5, // Wouldn't *pant* want you *pant* to think I'm outta shape *pant*
    0x0125, // Emi laughs - without breaking her stride, no less - and speeds up even more.
    0x0172, // Well, if this is the way we're going to play things…
    0x01A9, // I increase my own pace as well.
    0x01C9, // I can feel my lungs burning, and my legs are starting to question just what the hell I think I'm doing.
    0x0231, // Lactic acid screams in my muscles, but I close my ears.
    0x0269, // I can't let myself fall behind, because that would be a loss.
    0x02A7, // The rational voice in my head inquires mildly just when we started playing a game.
    0x02FA, // I'd answer it, but I'm having a lot of trouble thinking at present.

    0x0354, // How the hell does she keep it—{w=.5}{nw}
    0x037F, // It's like a string pulling at my chest, a choking feeling of narrowness and pain.
    0x03D1, // Before I can think of anything else than 'Oh shit,' the track disappears from under my feet.
    0x042E, // I stumble, one hand shooting down to clutch at my chest, the other hitting the track to keep me from falling on my face.
    0x04A7, // Emi whirls around and her eyes widen.
    0x04CD, // Hisao!
    0x04D4, // She yells at me, sprinting from the other side of the track.
    0x0511, // What's wrong?
    0x051F, // Nngh—Nothing, just…
    0x0537, // Keep your breathing steady.
    0x0553, // Calm down. Don't panic.
    0x056B, // Don't panic.
    0x0578, // Do you need me to get the nurse?
    0x0599, // I close my eyes, shutting out the outside world.
    0x05CA, // My heart struggles to regain its rhythm.
    0x05F3, // Slowly, the pain in my chest begins to subside.
    0x0623, // Soon it's gone like nothing happened.
    0x0649, // It was… nothing? No, something happened there.
    0x067A, // I open my eyes again and glance at a very worried Emi.
    0x06B1, // I think I'm fine.
    0x06C3, // My voice sounds weird even to myself, oddly even and matter-of-fact. It makes Emi frown.
    0x071C, // I don't think you are.
    0x0733, // She seems to come to a decision, and nods to herself.
    0x0769, // Right. You're coming with me.
    0x0787, // You've got to see the nurse.
    0x07A4, // Emi grabs my arm and drags me up. I feel a bit wobbly, but I refuse the shoulder Emi offers for support.
    0x080D, // Honestly, I'm a little ashamed by my own weakness.
    0x0840, // I'd really rather not have Emi concerned about me, but it seems to be too late.
    0x0890, // Heck, I'd really rather not have anyone concerned about my condition, though at this point, it seems to be too late for that as well.
    0x0916, // I'd like to be able to deal with the whole thing on my own, without being a bother to anyone else.
    0x0979, // While I'm wishing for things, I'd rather not have this condition in the first place.
    0x09CE, // Nurse!
    0x09D5, // Emi crashes into his office without knocking, but it doesn't alarm the nurse in the least.
    0x0A30, // Good morning, sunshine. What's up?
    0x0A53, // Sunshine? Anyway, he calmly sips from his coffee mug but lays it down after following Emi's gaze to me looming in the doorway.
    0x0AD2, // Hisao? What brings you here?
    0x0AEF, // We were running and he stumbled over and started grabbing at his chest and I thought I'd come get you and make him wait there but he said he was okay but then I thought you should see him anyway and—{w=1.5}{nw}
    0x0BC4, // Easy there, Emi. Calm down.
    0x0BE0, // Hisao, what happened?
    0x0BF6, // I don't know. We were running, and then my chest started hurting like that time before, but it went away after a few seconds.
    0x0C74, // It was just a flutter or something.
    0x0C98, // The nurse frowns, as if to say that 'just a flutter' is some kind of oxymoron.
    0x0CE7, // I didn't mean quite this when I suggested to get some exercise. You've got to be more careful, Hisao.
    0x0D4D, // I was being careful, I just…
    0x0D6C, // Come to think of it, 'I just got into a race with a member of the track team' doesn't seem as well reasoned as I thought it would.
    0x0DEF, // You just what?
    0x0DFE, // Er… that is…
    0x0E0F, // I was racing Emi.
    0x0E21, // Emi, is this true?
    0x0E34, // Emi fidgets, looking adorably contrite.
    0x0E5C, // Um, well…
    0x0E68, // Finally she can't seem to bring herself to say it aloud, and merely nods.
    0x0EB2, // The nurse sighs and rubs at his forehead with one hand tiredly.
    0x0EF2, // Emi, you've got to be more sensitive to the limits of others!
    0x0F30, // I don't know if he told you, but Hisao has a bad heart, and getting him to race you was incredibly irresponsible.
    0x0FA2, // Er, actually I started it.
    0x0FBD, // The nurse is stunned by my statement.
    0x0FE3, // You WHAT?
    0x0FED, // We were just running, and Emi started to pull away, and so I uh, sped up to catch her.
    0x1044, // The nurse stares at the ceiling, mutters a prayer for patience to some god or another, and looks back down at the both of us.
    0x10C2, // So you're {b}both{/b} stupid.
    0x10E0, // That's a comfort, I guess.
    0x10FB, // Now come on, Hisao. I've got to make sure your heart's not going to explode or something.
    0x1155, // I dutifully obey and follow him to the adjacent room where we ascertain that I am, in fact, not going to keel over and die.
    0x11D1, // So how does it feel?
    0x11E6, // I don't know. Nothing much. Tired, but it might be just from the exercise.
    0x1231, // You should stay here for a few hours and rest, and we'll see how you feel after that.
    0x1287, // I am not going to object, so I lie down on the infirmary bed.
    0x12C5, // A thoroughly miserable Emi comes in after getting an earful from the nurse in the other room.
    0x1323, // I couldn't hear what he said through the closed door, but I'm sure it wasn't pleasantries.
    0x137E, // Look, I'm really, really sorry.
    0x139E, // I should've been more careful.
    0x13BD, // Hey, you didn't know. It's not your fault.
    0x13E8, // She looks awfully down and sorry, and my reassurances don't do anything much to cheer her up.
    0x1446, // I want to make it up to you.
    0x1463, // Again with that decisive nod.
    0x1481, // So you have to come to lunch with me.
    0x14A7, // I'll bring it for you, okay? Something really really good!
    0x14E2, // I start with a 'You don't have to…' but then shut up and just nod at her when I see her face.
    0x1542, // Good!
    0x1548, // We meet on the roof.
    0x155D, // We?
    0x1561, // Yep! The weather's nice now, so the roof's a great spot for lunch, you know.
    0x15AE, // I see.
    0x15B5, // You'll come, right?
    0x15C9, // You wouldn't deny me the chance to make it up to you?
    0x15FF, // Of course not.
    0x160E, // Great! See you there!
    0x1624, // I stay afloat somewhere between asleep and awake, feeling completely drained.
    0x1672, // Not only my body, but all of me is limp and paralyzed, apart from my senses.
    0x16BF, // I swallow with difficulty and then try to lie as still as I can, which in this state is not a very hard thing to do.
    0x1734, // The nurse is shuffling around on the other side of the curtains he drew to give me privacy. I can see his shadow shifting about in the sunlight.
    0x17C5, // He has opened the window of his office. It's windy outside.
    0x1801, // The clean white curtains flutter in the breeze in a heavy, lazy motion, like waves. Light sifts through them slowly, half absorbing into the fabric.
    0x1896, // I close my eyes. The breeze on my face feels like the soft fabric of the curtains.
    0x18E9, // I listen to the sound of my heartbeat for a moment, trying to shut out the sound of the nurse tapping away on his computer, and my own heavy breathing.
    0x1981, // It's steady.
    0x198E, // Damn it, not even a week and I end up like this again. I really screwed up this time. Should've known better than to play the half-baked sports star in front of a real one.
    0x1A3B, // And why did I try to act brave, like that heart flutter was no big deal, even when it was obvious that it was?
    0x1AAA, // It was just a reflex, to push it away, to keep it inside.
    0x1AE4, // I didn't want it to happen.
    0x1B00, // I didn't want Emi to see it.
    0x1B1D, // Aaah…
    0x1B25, // Stupidstupidstupid.
    0x1B39, // I have to be more careful, or I will end up in the hospital again, or worse.
    0x1B86, // …
    0x1B8A, // That's my final thought before I give in to the tiredness.
    0x1BC5, // I fell asleep. For how long? What time is it?
    0x1BF3, // I'm feeling a little lightheaded and I keep blinking compulsively.
    0x1C36, // Pushing the curtain aside, I squint my eyes against the unfiltered light pouring in from the window. The texture of the canvas feels nothing like the wind did before.
    0x1CDD, // The nurse looks up from his work, sitting exactly where he was before.
    0x1D24, // How are you feeling?
    0x1D39, // I can't really tell, so I don't answer anything. I'm feeling kinda groggy from falling asleep at such a weird time, hopefully I don't look too weird.
    0x1DCF, // What time is it?
    0x1DE0, // Me croaking the question to gain some orientation. The nurse looking at his wristwatch before answering.
    0x1E49, // Things seem to happen in slow motion.
    0x1E6F, // Quarter past ten.
    0x1E81, // I try to think for a moment what that means but I'm not really sure.
    0x1EC6, // You didn't answer my question, Hisao.
    0x1EEC, // Oh. Fine.
    0x1EF6, // Climb down from that bed then, and let's see how you are doing. Don't…
    0x1F3F, // I try to do exactly that, only to sway dizzily when I move too fast. The nurse moves to support me by an arm and sighs.
    0x1FB7, // …stand up too quickly, is what I was going to say. Just sit there, I'll check your pressure to make sure.
    0x2023, // My good intentions sure lasted for a long time. I shut up, embarrassed with myself, while the nurse gets busy with an old-fashioned contraption and my arm. After a couple of minutes, he puts it away, looking neither pleased nor unhappy.
    0x2110, // You're all right. Head stopped spinning?
    0x2139, // Yeah.
    0x213F, // Good. And how are the contents doing?
    0x2165, // You didn't show very good judgment out there, Hisao.
    0x219A, // I swallow the retort I was going to make. It's what I was thinking myself, but hearing it stated by somebody else makes me want to protest.
    0x2226, // What he's saying is not pleasant to hear. Doesn't make him any less right.
    0x2271, // No, sir.
    0x227A, // He nods, still looking as neutral as he was before.
    0x22AE, // It would be easy to be angry at him if he said 'Told you so' or something, but he doesn't.
    0x2309, // I can try and help you to keep your health, but ultimately the last call lies with you. Hopefully this little episode will be something that'll remind you of that.
    0x23AD, // Here, a note for your teacher. To avoid an interrogation.
    0x23E7, // I take the slip of paper he's offering and then make my leave as I can't think of anything else to say, nor even really want to.
    0x2468, // Stay out of trouble, you hear me? I don't think it was anything but a scare, but next time could be different.
    0x24D7, // I hear you.
    0x24E3, // There is some way to get to the school building straight from the auxiliary building, but I'm not keen to find out and possibly get lost, so I go out from the exit that I know works.
    0x259A, // I stop at the stairs of the auxiliary building, deliberating for a moment between going to the dorms to get my books and stuff and going straight away to the class.
    0x263F, // The sun stings my eyes, so I head towards the dorms.
