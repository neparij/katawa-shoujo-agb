    0x0151, // What are you saying, Hicchan?
    0x016F, // It's just that I hardly think it's fair you can say that, seeing that I've helped you guys.
    0x01CB, // The mood has changed. This is like a showdown between two gunfighters now. Well, it was like that before too, but this time Shizune's focus is on me.

    0x03AE, // Hahaha~!
    0x03B7, // Shizune pushes her glasses up with her thumb, almost approvingly.
    0x03F9, // …
    0x03FD, // That's good! If you're not useless, you shouldn't let anyone say you are~! But the next time I say it, it'll really be because you are disappointing me like Miss Class Rep here, so don't let this go to your head!

    0x0593, // Her voice would cut the air of the classroom into half, if it was more tangible.

    0x064E, // Shizune, you really did go a little too far today.

    0x076F, // Hicchan, we have a few last minute things to take care of before class~! We might be late, so~! Can you please cover for us?
    0x07EC, // Yeah.
    0x07F2, // Perfect~! Yay~! Okay~! Thanks, Hicchan!
    0x081A, // They walk outside even though there are only ten minutes left before the bell will ring, signaling the start of class.
