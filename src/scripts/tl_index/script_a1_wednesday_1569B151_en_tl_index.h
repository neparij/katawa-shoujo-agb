    0x00A0, // Further down the corridor still with identical doors, are rooms that I didn't think were used for classes.
    0x010B, // I guess the art room is not a classroom as such.
    0x013C, // I carefully push open the furthest door, and peek in.
    0x0172, // It's a classroom, but it seems rather badly kept or not in use. Am I in the right place?
    0x01CB, // Desks and chairs are all around the room, a thin layer of dust settled on them. There are some easels in the corner so at least this looks like the right place.
    0x026C, // The room is flushed in sunlight from the big windows, shadows creeping all over the desks.
    0x02C7, // Specks of dust are dancing in the stagnant air, making the beams of light almost visible.
    0x0321, // Jokingly, I call into the empty room.
    0x0347, // Anybody ho—{w=.5}{nw}
    0x035F, // Something catches my eye and I stop mid-sentence.
    0x0391, // Sitting on a desk is a short-haired girl; curiously wearing a boy's uniform, with a fork between her toes, a morsel of food stuck firmly on the end.
    0x0426, // This odd way of dining seems to be caused by her apparent lack of hands, but her presence here is what takes me aback even more.
    0x04A7, // How did I miss her before? She's sitting in a corner very still, but I still somehow took her as a part of the furnishing or a statue at first glance.
    0x053E, // I'm not being too observant today, as a whole.
    0x056D, // The girl seems to be frozen in place, staring at me with her huge eyes like a rabbit in headlights.
    0x05D1, // She's staring at me, her mouth wide open, ready to accept the fork.
    0x0615, // I'm staring at her, my mouth wide open, suddenly remembering I didn't finish my sentence and trying to think if I should.
    0x068F, // This weird stalemate keeps us both stunned into silence, punctuated only by the wall clock ticking rhythmically.
    0x0700, // Hello.
    0x0707, // The girl stuffs the forkful in her mouth, and is now staring at me expectantly while chewing. This is a bit awkward.
    0x077C, // Umm… hello. I was told to pick up some supplies from here. For some festival stalls I think. I didn't think there would be someone here.
    0x0807, // There isn't. That's why I came here, too.
    0x0831, // She picks up another forkful.
    0x084F, // Doesn't that mean you're here, then?
    0x0874, // She raises her eyebrows as if she was suspecting my observation was false.
    0x08BF, // You are pretty observant. I guess it does. But who are you?
    0x08FB, // This girl is pretty straightforward, isn't she?
    0x092B, // I'm Nakai, Hisao Nakai. I just transferred in on Monday.
    0x0964, // I'm Rin. Tezuka Rin. Rin Tezuka.
    0x0985, // I won't shake hands with you, but at least we know who we are now.
    0x09C8, // That's very nice.
    0x09DA, // Her deadpan manner of talking makes it hard to determine whether she's joking about shaking hands or not.
    0x0A44, // It kinda bothers me, joking about these matters doesn't feel appropriate at all.
    0x0A95, // While I'm trying to figure what's appropriate and whether this girl is, she seems to have lost interest in me and is now gazing yearningly back at her food.
    0x0B32, // Can I continue my lunch? If you don't mind me, I won't mind you.
    0x0B73, // If you need to get your stuff, the supplies are at the back.
    0x0BB0, // Go right ahead. But… lunch? School's already over for the day.
    0x0BF1, // What word would you use then? There is no word for a meal you eat after lunch but before dinner, right? It bothers me very much too, but I don't really know what I should say.
    0x0CA1, // I don't think you are supposed to eat a meal between lunch and dinner to begin with.
    0x0CF6, // But I'm hungry now and my delicious boxed lunch would go to waste otherwise.
    0x0D43, // I have curry. It's very delicious.
    0x0D66, // With much decisiveness, Rin once again picks up the fork between her toes and with at least as much impoliteness, she points it straight at me.
    0x0DF6, // So, Nakai, what brings you to this place?
    0x0E20, // Like I said, I was told to look for these things.
    0x0E52, // No, the school. From outside you look fine. Is your problem inside?
    0x0E96, // I come to a full stop, opening my mouth but not getting a word out.
    0x0EDA, // I…
    0x0EDF, // I can guess. I am good at guessing. Better than most people.
    0x0F1C, // Rin cuts me off before I can answer her question, or skirt around it somehow. I don't know which I would've done.
    0x0F8E, // I froze in front of this issue again. I haven't even told anyone here about my condition, or maybe it's only because it hasn't really come up.
    0x101D, // I do get the feeling that not making issues of this is a part of the social code here, as the teacher said.
    0x1089, // I wonder if the people here could relate? Probably not any better than any normal person could.
    0x10E9, // I can't relate to Shizune's circumstances, or Lilly's, either.
    0x1128, // Naturally, while I go through this in my head, Rin keeps considering what my condition could be, with an overtly contemplative look on her face.
    0x11B9, // She puts her fork between her lips and leans back, looking at the ceiling as if the answer was written up there.
    0x122A, // A beam of light illuminates her face from the window side, creating a mask of dark shadow on the other side.
    0x1297, // I don't think it's anything in your head, and something in your guts would be boringly ordinary, like this lunch of mine. And less delicious.
    0x1325, // The problem must be in your pants!
    0x1348, // This messed-up Sherlock Holmes kind of statement and the sheer lack of tact it was delivered with catches me completely off guard.
    0x13CB, // I think I might've reeled back even physically as Rin's eyes widen in revelation and astonishment.
    0x142E, // So I was right! There's something wrong with your tackle, isn't there?
    0x1475, // Still partially in shock but recognizing the need to reply something, I spit out the first thing that I can think of.
    0x14EB, // No! Nothing like that. I have a heart problem. Arrhythmia.
    0x1526, // …
    0x152A, // I said it. More like blurted it out, but I said it.
    0x155E, // The girl in front of me purses her lips together and glowers at me, looking very disappointed.
    0x15BD, // How boring. Trouble in the pants would have been much more scandalous.
    0x1604, // What's with this reaction?
    0x161F, // I'm sorry to let you down.
    0x163A, // I forgive you. Just, I collect people and a person with, you know, that kind of problem would've been really great.
    0x16AE, // Collect people?
    0x16BE, // People with different problems.
    0x16DE, // Huh, so you just… like, go around asking people what's wrong with them?
    0x1728, // Pretty much.
    0x1735, // I see.
    0x173C, // …
    0x1740, // With little left to say, Rin resumes her lunch and the conversation dies away, but I keep thinking about what was said.
    0x17B8, // It's the first time I told anyone else about my condition. All the other people have either known about it already, or heard about it from someone else.
    0x1851, // Or didn't need to know about it, like every other student here, so far.
    0x1899, // Should I have told it as a natural part of introductions? Is it expected of me?
    0x18E9, // 'Hi, I'm Hisao. I have a very serious heart condition.'
    0x1921, // Is that how I'm supposed to go around introducing myself from now on?
    0x1967, // As if our disabilities would define us. What a disgusting thought.
    0x19AA, // Or maybe this Tezuka girl just has an unnatural interest in such things.
    0x19F3, // As I walk to the back of the room to pick up the items on Misha's list, a chance opens to study Rin from the corner of my eye.
    0x1A72, // Her hair is a burnt auburn, almost orange, and cropped short. Long hair would probably be impossible with no arms.
    0x1AE5, // The boy's uniform and the lack of arms make her look very thin, almost scrawny.
    0x1B35, // She is not particularly pretty except for her murky green eyes which flicker restlessly from below her short bangs, even when she eats.
    0x1BBD, // The distance and the shadows make it seem like they don't reflect sunlight at all, but instead absorb all of it within them like deep wells.
    0x1C4A, // She moves her feet almost as deftly as a normal person would use their arms.
    0x1C97, // However, I can see how this sight could discomfort people, especially while eating. It makes me feel a bit uncomfortable at least.
    0x1D1A, // I hesitate to think about the word 'unnatural' but it's too late now, isn't it?
    0x1D6A, // I keep searching the cabins and shelves for Misha's things, but after enough time passes the silence grows too uncomfortable, so I try to force some conversation out of this strange girl.
    0x1E26, // So, do you always eat alone and this late? Or do you get the occasional visitor?
    0x1E77, // Visitors… maybe you are my first occasional visitor. But I don't always eat alone either.
    0x1ED3, // Sometimes I eat with a certain person on the roof, if she's not horsing around.
    0x1F23, // Horsing?
    0x1F2C, // She likes to do sports.
    0x1F44, // Oh.
    0x1F48, // And that's all I can think of to say.
    0x1F6E, // Both of us fall silent again as Rin forks the last bits of her meal to her mouth.
    0x1FC0, // I look down at my haul and double check it with Misha's list. It seems I have everything except plywood.
    0x2029, // Umm… so, I think I have all the things now.
    0x2057, // That's very nice for you. Don't feel obliged to stay. I was about to take a nap anyway.
    0x20AF, // You need to do whatever you are going to do with that stuff anyway, right?
    0x20FA, // Or perhaps you like to watch girls sleeping?
    0x2127, // Ehh…
    0x212E, // I'm not sure what to make of this, but Rin looks serious.
    0x2168, // Even if I did, I think I have to be going.
    0x2193, // I… I'll catch you around, Tezuka.
    0x21B7, // You can call me Rin.
    0x21CC, // I feel that our relationship is at this point good enough to warrant this much.
    0x221C, // I was already turning to make my exit, but she draws me back in.
    0x225D, // Fine, then I'm Hisao.
    0x2273, // Then you are.
    0x2281, // …
    0x2285, // Rin looks at me hard in the eyes but that intimidating feeling you get when someone stares at you isn't there.
    0x22F4, // It's like she's actually not looking at me at all.
    0x2327, // She blinks a couple of times, and I can't figure out why a pause like this just popped between us out of nowhere.
    0x2399, // See you later, Hisao.
    0x23AF, // There is something like a tiny smile there in her face, maybe.
    0x23EE, // I quietly back out of the room. As I shut the door in front of my face, I whisper to myself.
    0x244B, // What an intriguing person…
    0x2468, // From inside, I hear a muffled, sing-song voice:
    0x2498, // I heard tha~t!
