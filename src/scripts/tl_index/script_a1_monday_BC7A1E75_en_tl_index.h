    0x004D, // Just like everything in this school, the cafeteria seems too spacious and oddly modern in contrast to the classic exterior.
    0x00C9, // Its big windows open to the courtyard, towards the main gate.
    0x0107, // It's the cafeteria~!
    0x011C, // Her enthusiastic statement of the obvious makes people around us stare, but Misha doesn't seem to care so we proceed to the line.
    0x019E, // There is a rather long list of menu options, which seems great until I realize that many of them are to accommodate students who need special diets.
    0x0233, // How nice. It almost feels like I'm back at the hospital, eating portions measured with scientific precision to meet the needs of the patients.
    0x02C2, // I pick something at random and follow Shizune to a table, sitting opposite of her.
    0x0315, // As I nibble indifferently at the food I'd rather not eat, Misha pokes me in the side to get my attention and points to Shizune.
    0x0395, // …
    0x0399, // I don't understand sign, so the point escapes me.
    0x03CB, // Maybe looking at a person who 'talks' to you is proper and polite?
    0x040E, // Do you want to know something?
    0x042D, // What?
    0x0433, // About anything! We're your guides so you should ask if there is something~!
    0x047F, // Misha and Shizune sign back and forth very animatedly, throwing sideway glances at me but Misha refrains from translating.
    0x04FA, // Maybe they are talking about secret girl stuff or something.
    0x0537, // …
    0x053B, // I quickly notice a conversation in sign is not enough to fill a silence.
    0x0584, // We arrive in the classroom early, but we're not the first.
    0x05BF, // That dark haired girl I noticed before is slumped over her desk at the last row.
    0x0610, // She jumps a little when Misha crashes into the room with the elegance of a rhino.
    0x0662, // She shrinks deeper into her seat. I can feel her tension all the way from here, as if she were slowly turning into stone just from our presence.
    0x06F3, // Misha and Shizune either don't notice or don't mind it, as they walk directly past her to their seats and begin to converse.
    0x0770, // I'm left wondering about her, even when the classroom slowly fills with other students and finally, the teacher.
    0x07E1, // Getting into the rhythm of school feels strange; it's as if my brain remembers how this is done, but my body doesn't.
    0x0857, // Towards the end of the class I start yawning and counting the minutes left.
    0x08A3, // I shouldn't be this tired on my first day of school.
    0x08D8, // Maybe it's the long time spent in the hospital that made me like this. I'm even feeling physically weak and lifeless.
    0x094E, // Before long, the final bell rings.
    0x0971, // School is finally over for the day.
    0x0995, // Beside me, Misha and Shizune are having a short conversation. After a bit of deliberation, Misha turns to me.
    0x0A03, // …
    0x0A07, // Unfortunately we can't stay and show you around today, Hicchan. We've got to hurry already, since there is a lot of work for us to do.
    0x0A8E, // …
    0x0A92, // You'll find your way around here, I'm sure of it.
    0x0AC4, // Ah, wait! The teacher said I'd have to see the nurse. Where do I have to go?
    0x0B11, // Is that so? We can at least show you that much~!
    0x0B42, // Come on, the nurses have their own building, so we have to go outside.
    0x0B89, // We join the flow of students making their way down the stairwell and outside, with the girls pointing out other senior classrooms in the same hallway as ours.
    0x0C28, // When we get outside, the girls make their way to the smaller building right next to the school.
    0x0C88, // It's built in the same style, so it looks like it's actually a part of the main building.
    0x0CE2, // …
    0x0CE6, // This is the auxiliary building here. There's a lot of official and important stuff inside, like the Yamaku Foundation office and all the nurses' offices. They even have a swimming pool!
    0x0DA0, // How is that official?
    0x0DB6, // …
    0x0DBA, // Don't be silly, Hicchan! It's for physical therapy of course.
    0x0DF8, // Anyway, all the nursing staff facilities are in there too. The head nurse's office is on the first floor.
    0x0E62, // You'll be fine from here, right~? We'll be going, then! See you tomorrow!
    0x0EAC, // Yeah, thanks. Bye.
    0x0EBF, // A whole building for stuff that has nothing to do with the actual education?
    0x0F0C, // I guess it's necessary for a place like this.
    0x0F3A, // I walk in, hoping that this really will be only a quick visit like the teacher said.
    0x0F8F, // On a white door on the left is a green cross with the text 'Head Nurse' and a nameplate.
    0x0FE8, // A voice from the inside responds to my knock almost immediately, but I can't quite make it out.
    0x1048, // It sounded a bit like an invitation to open the door, so I invite myself further in.
    0x109D, // The room is not large and it smells strange. A friendly-looking man turns around on his office chair to face me as I enter.
    0x1119, // His desk is neat and tidy, but the bin under the table is overflowing with used medical utensils and there are at least a dozen coffee-cup rings lingering on the desk.
    0x11C1, // Hello there. What can I do for you today?
    0x11EB, // He is young-looking and sort of rugged, but the dimples in his cheeks wash that impression away when he smiles.
    0x125B, // Erm, are you the nurse?
    0x1273, // He smiles like a person who has heard this very same question hundreds of times.
    0x12C4, // Why yes, I am. It says so on the door, no?
    0x12EF, // You can call me by my name or just 'the nurse' like everyone else.
    0x1332, // Of course. I shake off my confusion, realizing I probably should grab his extended hand.{w} His handshake is rather firm and friendly.
    0x13B9, // Right… err, I'm a new student and my homeroom teacher told me to come and meet you. My name is Hisao Nakai.
    0x1427, // His eyes light up with revelation and he snaps his fingers.
    0x1463, // Oh you're THAT Nakai. I was just reading your file in the morning.
    0x14A6, // Some kind of chronic arrhythmia and related congenital heart muscle deficiency, right?
    0x14FD, // He gestures me to sit down in a vacant armchair in front of his desk.
    0x1543, // Eh, yes.
    0x154C, // Good. Well, you've probably been briefed about the school enough, so I'll just go over this quickly.
    0x15B1, // We have all kinds of facilities available, mostly physical therapy and such.
    0x15FE, // There's always someone from my staff around, even at night, so never hesitate to call us if there is a problem.
    0x166E, // The famous twenty-four-hour nursing staff.
    0x1699, // Wow, this is like a hospital.
    0x16B7, // Well, not exactly. For instance, we don't do brain surgery here.
    0x16F8, // His joke feels so out of place that I'm left thinking why he even said it.
    0x1743, // Yeah… just that it's really weird to have so many medical people at a school.
    0x1793, // You'll get used to it.
    0x17AA, // I'm not so sure of that myself but I don't let the nurse know it.
    0x17EC, // Now, let me just find your file again…
    0x1815, // While he searches for something from his computer and shuffles stacks of papers around, I let my gaze wander around the room.
    0x1893, // It's the epitome of generic, I'd like to say.
    0x18C1, // Beige walls and ceiling, dark gray laminate flooring, and all the equipment you'd expect from a school nurse's office.
    0x1938, // Even the ridiculous educational posters are hanging on all four walls, reminding me to eat properly - three times a day and from all the food groups.
    0x19CE, // Smiling, the nurse draws a thick file from a stack of similarly thick files and opens it.
    0x1A28, // So, you already have medication for the arrhythmia, just remember to take your pills every morning and evening or it won't be much help.
    0x1AB1, // Apart from that… do you do any sports? Rash stuff like… I don't know, boxing?
    0x1B03, // He grins to his own joke but I don't.
    0x1B29, // Eh, well. I played soccer occasionally with some classmates.
    0x1B66, // All right, I'm afraid I'm going to have to recommend you refrain from doing that. At least, for the time being.
    0x1BD6, // Oh.
    0x1BDA, // My lack of reaction makes him raise an eyebrow, but really, I'm not too bothered by him forbidding me to kick a ball around.
    0x1C57, // I guess I never did it out of burning passion for the sport. Just to have something to do.
    0x1CB2, // Any kind of concussion might be very dangerous to your heart, and risking another attack is not a good idea.
    0x1D1F, // Was the previous one caused by a sudden concussion to the chest area? There is no mention of the cause in your papers.
    0x1D96, // Err… not exactly.
    0x1DAA, // I sidestep the question acceptably, and he glances at me over his papers, with a more serious expression on his face.
    0x1E20, // Still, you need to keep your body healthy so some exercise would do you good.
    0x1E6E, // We have physical therapy and such available as I said, but I don't think you really need such heavy measures.
    0x1EDC, // Just get some light exercise regularly.
    0x1F04, // Brisk walks or even light jogging, jumping rope, that sort of thing. Swimming, maybe? There's a pool here.
    0x1F6F, // So I was told.
    0x1F7E, // You were? Very good.
    0x1F93, // At any rate, and I'm sure you've been told this before, you just need to take care not to overexert yourself.
    0x2001, // He wags his finger to emphasize the point. No need really, I've heard this a thousand times already.
    0x2066, // Absolutely no unnecessary risks. Take care of yourself.
    0x209E, // Okay.
    0x20A4, // He goes over my papers one more time and sets them on the desk, obviously content.
    0x20F7, // Good. That's it, then. Come meet me if you ever need something.
    0x2137, // I'm ushered out before I even realize it. A quick visit, indeed.
    0x2178, // Hmm, I wonder…
    0x2189, // Ask about the library.
    0x21A0, // Ask about Shizune's deafness.
    0x21BE, // I think I got everything I need to know.
