    0x001E, // I open my mouth to say that actually, we're not both needed for such a simple task like finding another pot of Prussian Blue, but Emi's already grabbed my arm and started dragging me off.
    0x00DA, // I wave to Rin, who doesn't seem to have noticed that the two of us are even leaving.
    0x012F, // Well, she'll notice when she goes for her Prussian Blue and finds out it's still not there.
    0x018B, // Maybe.
    0x0192, // …
    0x0196, // Probably not, actually.
    0x01AE, // While I'm busy thinking of how weird Rin is, Emi's been dragging me back to the art classroom.
    0x020D, // I feel myself starting to run out of breath.
    0x023A, // What's the rush?
    0x024B, // Huh?
    0x0250, // Emi's giving me an appraising look, as if she's trying to figure something out.
    0x02A0, // It's just that you seem to be in a hurry.
    0x02CA, // I'm not sure I can keep up.
    0x02E6, // Comprehension dawns on her face.
    0x0307, // You're not out of breath, are you?
    0x032A, // There's almost an accusing playfulness to her tone.
    0x035E, // I'm tempted to deny it, but then I realize that I've been breathing heavy since we stopped.
    0x03BA, // Guess it's kind of obvious.
    0x03D6, // A little. Not everybody can be in shape, you know.
    0x0409, // Takes all kinds, right?
    0x0421, // Emi frowns. It's not a particularly good frown.
    0x0451, // Er, that is…
    0x0460, // I should… get in shape?
    0x047A, // Not that I hadn't already decided to try for that.
    0x04AD, // After that flutter on the track I figure there's a real need to get in some sort of running habit.
    0x0510, // I was, after all, feeling pretty good until I had my false alarm.
    0x0552, // Well, actually I wasn't. But it was… fun?
    0x057E, // Meanwhile, my comment seems to have helped Emi come to some sort of a decision.
    0x05CE, // Well, that's it, then.
    0x05E5, // She gives me a serious look.
    0x0602, // You're joining me.
    0x0615, // …
    0x0619, // I beg your pardon?
    0x062C, // In the mornings.
    0x063D, // You and I are now running partners.
    0x0661, // I've got a routine all planned out. In fact…
    0x0690, // She produces a crumpled sheet of paper.
    0x06B8, // I've got it right here with me.
    0x06D8, // I take the sheet of paper and give it a once-over.
    0x070B, // Times, dates, and laps, all laid out.
    0x0731, // A slow increase from just a few laps a day to…
    0x0762, // My God, does she expect to have me running marathons?
    0x0798, // And where did she find the time to get this all together?
    0x07D2, // And how long has she been planning this, anyway?
    0x0803, // You've been planning this?
    0x081E, // A little.
    0x0828, // But it's really the nurse's idea!
    0x084A, // He told me to keep an eye on you to make sure you exercised like he told you to!
    0x089B, // A vast conspiracy?
    0x08AE, // Maybe Kenji's on to something here…
    0x08D4, // This seems a bit much for just 'keeping an eye on me.'
    0x090B, // Well, to be honest I've been trying to find a running partner in the mornings for a while now.
    0x096A, // My God, Kenji! If you could only see the scheme unfolding!
    0x09A5, // What do you need a partner for, anyway?
    0x09CD, // It's easier to keep up a workout if you're not the only one doing it.
    0x0A13, // Isn't that obvious?
    0x0A27, // You're less likely to quit if someone else is counting on you to be there, right?
    0x0A79, // I see. And this won't only keep you running, but it'll make sure that I keep running as well.
    0x0AD7, // Meaning that I'll be obeying the nurse…
    0x0B01, // …and I'll be keeping an eye on you just like he asked!
    0x0B3A, // You caught on quick, Hisao.
    0x0B56, // And if I refuse?
    0x0B67, // I have no intention of refusing, of course.
    0x0B93, // But I've got to at least put up a token resistance to such a masterfully executed plan.
    0x0BEB, // Well, if you refused I'd have to pout.
    0x0C12, // And you'd have to live with being the guy who made Emi Ibarazaki pout.
    0x0C59, // You don't want that on your conscience, do you?
    0x0C89, // As if to demonstrate, Emi begins pouting.
    0x0CB3, // It is the most adorable, heart-wrenching thing I've ever seen.
    0x0CF2, // Okay! I'll do it!
    0x0D04, // Just… don't do that!
    0x0D1B, // I feel like I just hit a puppy!
    0x0D3B, // So it's settled, right?
    0x0D53, // You're going to be my running partner?
    0x0D7A, // Follow the workout?
    0x0D8E, // And the dietary plan?
    0x0DA4, // Dietary plan?
    0x0DB2, // Yeah, the dietary plan!
    0x0DCA, // You've got to eat healthy if you're going to get in shape, you know!
    0x0E0F, // I examine the workout routine closely.
    0x0E36, // I don't see a dietary plan on here.
    0x0E5A, // Oh right! I forgot to give that to you!
    0x0E82, // Another crumpled sheet of paper is produced and handed over.
    0x0EBF, // It's somewhat less detailed.
    0x0EDC, // I had the nurse help me come up with it.
    0x0F05, // The amount of dedication that the nurse has to keeping me in good health is pretty overwhelming.
    0x0F66, // I don't know many school nurses who would get one of their students to spy on me, much less help come up with a dietary plan.
    0x0FE4, // Then again, I guess I'm not in a normal school.
    0x1014, // And maybe that's not such a bad thing.
    0x103B, // Then again, this dietary plan seems to cut out just about everything that'll be offered at the festival tomorrow.
    0x10AD, // Hmm.
    0x10B2, // So when does our running start?
    0x10D2, // After the festival.
    0x10E6, // Right after? What if I've had something to eat there? I could get a stomach ache, you know.
    0x1142, // I meant the day after the festival.
    0x1166, // I knew that.
    0x1173, // Wasn't there something we were supposed to be doing?
    0x11A8, // Oh! I guess we should get that paint for Rin, huh?
    0x11DB, // Oh no! It slipped my mind!
    0x11F6, // By the time we get the paint and get back to the mural, Rin's already wandered off.
    0x124A, // Oh well.
    0x1253, // Emi and I both decide to part ways there, leaving the paint on the ground.
    0x129E, // Rin'll find it. Whenever she comes back, anyway.
    0x12CF, // Festival's tomorrow. I'm actually a little excited for it.
    0x130A, // At the same time, the week's left me feeling pretty tired, so I read a little and then go to bed.
