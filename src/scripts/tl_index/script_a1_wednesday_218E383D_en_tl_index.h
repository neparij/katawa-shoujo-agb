    0x0000, // I feel very tired this morning, probably because yesterday itself was a very tiring day. On top of that, I woke up far earlier than necessary.
    0x008F, // After saying hi to Shizune and Misha, I start doing the work as instructed from the board. It already looks like today is going to be heavy.
    0x011C, // I don't have a problem with that now, though. Shizune and Misha might jump on me trying to get an answer about whether or not I've decided to join the Student Council, even if it's just one day.
    0x01DF, // I wouldn't put it past them to try, and I don't have an answer for them if they do. So, this situation is convenient for me.
    0x025C, // About ten minutes into class, Hanako walks in and takes a seat, but no one looks at her. The teacher doesn't even comment on her lateness.
    0x02E7, // He does, however, stop us to say that we're going to break into groups again.
    0x0335, // I turn my head and see that Shizune and Misha are looking at me. Shizune gives me a smile that is equal parts cute and menacing. This is a smile that says 'We have you now. There is no escape.'
    0x03F7, // Hicchan~, it looks like we're together again! Yay yay~!
    0x042F, // Misha leans sideways while Shizune pushes her desk closer to mine. There really is no escape now unless I were to jump through the window.
    0x04BA, // Jumping out the window isn't the best option, sadly.
    0x04EF, // …
    0x04F3, // What's wrong, Hicchan?
    0x050A, // …
    0x050E, // Oh… Hicchan, have you been thinking about what you said yesterday? You said that you would think about joining the Student Council, didn't you?
    0x05A0, // It's okay, Hicchan. We were talking about it after you left, and it would be rude to expect you to already have an answer for us this early, right? Right~!
    0x063C, // Hahahahahaha~!
    0x064B, // I'm so happy you two are able to have a laugh at my expense, and even more pleased to know that you both know how crazy the two of you can be.
    0x06DA, // Now that that's over, Shizune snaps back into serious mode and smacks today's assignment with the back of her hand in an overly dramatic and important way.
    0x0776, // When I actually look at the stuff, it's mostly just reading. In fact, there are only two problems.
    0x07D9, // I almost want to say something about how her rush to get started seems a bit much, considering the small amount of work. In fact, Shizune probably knows how little there is, and simply doesn't care.
    0x08A0, // Yeah, it seems like the workload doesn't matter to her as much as the fact that there is work; the actual amount is unimportant. She approaches everything with the same level of ambition.
    0x095C, // While I'm reading, I let my eyes wander around the room and catch Hanako trying her hand at solving the problems. It looks like she's working alone.
    0x09F1, // I can't remember seeing her working with other people before.
    0x0A2F, // Thinking back to how shy she is, it's understandable.
    0x0A65, // Hey, that girl over there…
    0x0A82, // Huh? Who, Hicchan?
    0x0A95, // Her. Hanako. Over there. Does she always work alone?
    0x0ACA, // I think so, Hicchan. Do you feel sorry for her because she's alone?
    0x0B0E, // I was just thinking that maybe she could work with us, or something.
    0x0B53, // Hmmmm… No, I don't think that would be a good idea, Hicchan.
    0x0B92, // Why not?
    0x0B9B, // Shicchan wouldn't get along with her.
    0x0BC1, // Why?
    0x0BC6, // Misha shuffles around the question, letting out a laugh that sounds very strange; it's nervous, but still has that lilting up-and-down quality present in everything she says.
    0x0C75, // Just because, Hicchan.
    0x0C8C, // By now, Shizune has noticed our conversation, and it makes me realize again how Misha has been signing everything she has been saying this whole time.
    0x0D23, // …
    0x0D27, // What, Shicchan? The friend of my enemy is my enemy? That sounds so harsh, I'm not going to say that.
    0x0D8C, // You said it anyway.
    0x0DA0, // I know, Hicchan, it's fine if you overhear~!
    0x0DCD, // I wonder if this is Misha's way of keeping things fair, since without her, I wouldn't be able to understand a thing Shizune is saying, and vice versa.
    0x0E64, // Is that also why she signs all the time, so there is never a conversation Shizune will be left out of?
    0x0ECB, // …
    0x0ECF, // Anyway, we should start on the problems now, Hicchan.
    0x0F05, // We finish with time to spare, and I decide to ask if there are any alternatives to the cafeteria, as frankly, the food so far has been subpar.
    0x0F94, // This sends Shizune and Misha arguing among themselves about their favorite restaurants. All of them are downtown, so I don't think we have time to go all the way there. And what about the bill?
    0x1056, // Are they arguing just for the fun of it?
    0x107F, // Maybe. They seem so distracted by it that they don't even notice the start of the actual lunch break.
    0x10E5, // I look over my shoulder towards the back of the classroom.
    0x1120, // She seems to be studying her notes from the previous class.
    0x115C, // It's an odd sight; everyone else in the class is busying themselves with the lunch break.
    0x11B6, // Socializing, gossiping, rearranging desks, the ones with actual boxed lunches mixed in and chattering like everyone else, only interrupted by short bouts of eating.
    0x125B, // But, when I watch Hanako, it feels that I'm the only one who can see her. Almost as if she was invisible; sort of hiding in plain sight.
    0x12E4, // Is she being bullied? Is she isolating herself from the rest of the class on her own accord?
    0x1341, // I see her look over her shoulder towards the classroom's rear door.
    0x1385, // Come to think of it, she hasn't turned a page since I've started watching her.
    0x13D4, // I guess she's waiting for someone.
    0x13F7, // Read my book.
    0x1405, // Go talk with Hanako.
    0x141A, // Wait for Shizune and Misha to come to a decision.
