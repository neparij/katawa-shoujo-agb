    0x0000, // After school, Shizune and Misha quickly find me by the first floor lobby and latch onto me, covering each flank in case I might try to escape.
    0x008F, // I feel a little offended, but I'd been considering it. Nevertheless, I'm a bit disturbed that enough people have made a break for it in the past that they're on their guard.
    0x013D, // What's with the escort? This doesn't make me feel very comfortable.
    0x0181, // In fact, it makes me feel like a dangerous prisoner being transported to his cell.
    0x01D4, // Wahahaha! What's wrong, Hicchan?
    0x01F5, // …
    0x01F9, // That's right, we're just going to go play a game of Risk, remember?
    0x023D, // I don't know, Misha, this all seems a little sinister to me. I start thinking that when we sit down to play the game, they'll tie me down and torture me until I agree to join the Student Council.
    0x0301, // Well, that's highly unlikely, but still… For some reason, it just seems like it would be so plausible…
    0x036C, // Getting to the student council room is as simple as turning two corners from where we started.
    0x03CB, // What? That's it? This makes you guys being so on top of me seem a little silly.
    0x041B, // …
    0x041F, // That's not true, Hicchan, Shicchan says that when their life is threatened, people have shown the capability to pull off superhuman bursts of speed.
    0x04B4, // 'Life is threatened?'
    0x04CA, // Her expression unchanging, Misha signs something amusedly to Shizune, who makes a baffling face and puts her hands behind her back, looking pleased with herself.
    0x056C, // Mm~ hm hm hm~…
    0x057D, // Misha feigns deafness and hums cheerily. Stop that, I know you heard me; you have no excuse, unlike Shizune.
    0x05EA, // Shizune opens the door to the student council room. It's a very plain, sparsely decorated room, although it is quite large, maybe even a little larger than a classroom.
    0x0693, // There's a big table in the center surrounded by chairs, and a smaller desk prominently placed in the back that I assume is Shizune's. There are a few regular desks and chairs stacked to one side, as well. Extras, perhaps?
    0x0771, // Aside from the tables and chairs, the room doesn't have much else to offer. Just a couple of filing cabinets and bookshelves stacked with old school records and documents. Not much else. In fact, nothing else.
    0x0843, // This is… a pretty bleak room. They could at least put a potted plant in here, or something. But the most noticeable thing that this room doesn't have is other people.
    0x08EC, // Are we early?
    0x08FA, // …
    0x08FE, // No~.
    0x0903, // What do you mean 'no?' Does it mean nobody else is coming today?
    0x0944, // …
    0x0948, // Yeah, that's right~.
    0x095D, // Before I manage to ask why that's the case, Shizune claps her hands together very energetically.
    0x09BE, // …
    0x09C2, // Hicchan, let's play Risk! Come on, you promised, didn't you? You have to~!
    0x0A0D, // Hahaha~! Okay okay okay~! Do you want to know the rules? We can explain to you while we set everything up!
    0x0A78, // While Misha is talking, Shizune takes out what looks like a board game from behind one of the filing cabinets and throws it on the table.
    0x0B02, // Actually, this looks kind of interesting.
    0x0B2C, // After Misha spends a little too long for her liking running through the basics with a somewhat vague and confusing tutorial, Shizune cuts in and declares the game has started with a decisive motion, slicing her arm through the air.
    0x0C14, // Shizune's aggressiveness is rubbing off onto me. I start feeling more competitive than I intended to be when I agreed to this.
    0x0C93, // Halfway into the game, while I try to ponder how to defend against Shizune's assault from two fronts, she breaks my concentration by drumming her fingers on the table to get my attention.
    0x0D4F, // …
    0x0D53, // Hicchan, Shicchan wants you to know that you are taking too long to make a move.
    0x0DA4, // Shicchan also says that she will let you keep Australia if you agree to join the Student Council~!
    0x0E07, // I thought this was a game with no strings attached.
    0x0E3B, // Just the fact that she would dangle that over my head as an offer means that she knows I care about the outcome of this game.
    0x0EB9, // And anyway: No!
    0x0EC9, // …
    0x0ECD, // Shicchan admires your fighting spirit and would be a benevolent dictator who will spare your people if you agree to join the Student Council~!
    0x0F5C, // Hahahaha~!
    0x0F67, // You're so competitive, Shizune.
    0x0F87, // She seems to take this as a compliment.
    0x0FAF, // I would expect the Student Council president to be a little more magnanimous.
    0x0FFD, // Mag—nan—i—mous…?
    0x1016, // She doesn't seem to know what the word means or how it's signed, so she pulls out a piece of paper and writes it for Shizune, who in return signs it back to Misha.
    0x10BA, // Misha presses her index fingers against her temples, as if trying to physically imprint the word into her memory.
    0x112C, // …
    0x1130, // Suddenly, Shizune bursts into a flurry of gestures. Misha looks daunted by the pace of her heated signing.
    0x119B, // Ah, wait, please slow down, Shicchan… Um, Hicchan~! Shicchan says you're going to lose!
    0x11F5, // Tell her I will crush her world empire with my rebellion.
    0x122F, // Ah… Okay…
    0x123D, // Those eyes of hers shine with childlike mischief.
    0x126F, // …
    0x1273, // I take a glance at the clock on the wall and realize I've spent far longer playing Risk than I expected.
    0x12DC, // Sorry, I think I have to go. I wanted to go to the library. It's not closed yet, is it?
    0x1334, // Shizune scratches her head and gestures at Misha.
    0x1366, // How hard can it be to determine whether the library is open? There's a clock right there on the wall.
    0x13CC, // …
    0x13D0, // It should be, unless the librarian is absent.
    0x13FE, // I think you're right, Shicchan.
    0x141E, // We… think the library is open. It's on the second floor; can't miss it. Do you want us to show you where it is?
    0x1490, // No thanks, it's okay. See you tomorrow.
    0x14B8, // Bye bye!
    0x14C1, // She says you have no chance if you keep playing like this, no you won't~!
    0x150B, // She has a point. Attack aggressively!
    0x1531, // It's a trap, it's smarter to play defensively here.
