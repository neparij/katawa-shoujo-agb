    0x0000, // The teacher seems like an okay person despite the weird first impression I got, and the material is relatively interesting.
    0x007C, // However, the way he teaches is really bizarre. It's as if he expects that everyone is a natural genius.
    0x00E4, // When the final bell sounds, I realize that there is still a lot of time left in the day, and I'm left wondering what to do.
    0x0160, // It's odd, at the hospital I had 24 hours a day of free time, but here filling the considerably shorter hours feels difficult.
    0x01DE, // Everyone else leaves, and I'm left alone with the teacher.
    0x0219, // Mutou is examining the assignment sheets we were working on earlier, marking them with a red ballpen.
    0x027F, // Raising his eyes from his papers briefly, he notices me and furrows his brow.
    0x02CD, // What is it, Nakai?
    0x02E0, // I jump at him addressing me, but I guess it's natural to spark some conversation since there is nobody else around.
    0x0354, // Umm… nothing. Thinking about what I'd do after school.
    0x038D, // The teacher slowly puts the cap on the pen he is holding and arranges his papers into a stack, clacking it against the desk twice.
    0x0410, // He seems very methodical and for a brief moment I'm reminded of Shizune, but the teacher is more unhurried and relaxed, much more routined.
    0x049C, // You have no plans?
    0x04AF, // No. I considered joining a club, but don't know what kind of club would interest me.
    0x0504, // Go observe a meeting of someone else's club. Might pique your interest.
    0x054C, // I guess…
    0x0557, // I just…
    0x0561, // But I don't know how to continue from there.
    0x058E, // Mutou looks at me in a way that makes me quickly want to take the words back to avoid a conversation.
    0x05F4, // But I can't, so I have to forge ahead.
    0x061B, // I just don't know how to deal with people. I mean, the other students.
    0x0662, // I'm talking to people and everything, so it's not that I'd be isolated or anything.
    0x06B6, // I just don't know what to think about… the disabilities. It's like… it feels that I'm being impolite if I pay attention to them, and it's weird to ignore them.
    0x075A, // Damned if I do, damned if I don't.
    0x077D, // The teacher scratches his cheek absentmindedly, looking very unresponsive.
    0x07C8, // These things are only an issue if you make them one.
    0x07FD, // You can talk normally with someone, even if they are blind or something.
    0x0846, // Try to look behind the superficial. There's not a single student here who isn't just a normal kid behind whatever they might seem at first glance.
    0x08D9, // He says the same thing as Yuuko did.
    0x08FE, // I know they're right, but it's hard. How can you not consider for example Shizune's deafness, when the only way to communicate with her is to talk through Misha?
    0x09A0, // Or Hanako… it's not like you can ignore her face.
    0x09D4, // But…
    0x09DB, // I'm interrupted by the door of the classroom suddenly slamming open.
    0x0A20, // Teacher~!
    0x0A2A, // Misha crashes in, hand straight in an enthusiastic greeting, her voice loud and lively enough to wake the dead from their graves.
    0x0AAC, // She starts towards the teacher's desk with her bouncing step, hands energetically swinging with the rhythm.
    0x0B18, // Mutou, visibly dismayed at the interruption and Misha in general, slumps in his chair.
    0x0B6F, // Mikado.
    0x0B77, // Misha stops in her tracks and looks around cluelessly, as if she's sensing from his tone that something's wrong but has no idea what.
    0x0BFD, // Yes~?
    0x0C03, // We have talked about volume control before.
    0x0C2F, // Yes~!
    0x0C35, // But she doesn't lower her voice at all, and the teacher just rubs his eyes.
    0x0C81, // So, what is it?
    0x0C91, // I… we need help! We are running out of supplies for the festival stands!
    0x0CDC, // This is a distress!
    0x0CF0, // She waves a pink slip of paper she's holding around.
    0x0D25, // So… go get more supplies from the art room. What's the problem with that?
    0x0D71, // Plywood! Plywood is always the problem! Last time we wanted more there was only a little, but that time we just took it all and went with that.
    0x0E01, // Now there's like none left there, so do you know where there is some?
    0x0E47, // I don't understand. How would I know?
    0x0E6D, // Shicchan… I mean the president thought that a teacher would know if there is plywood. Was she wrong?
    0x0ED4, // Mutou looks like he is in great pain, frowning with his entire essence, and Misha doesn't get it at all.
    0x0F3D, // Looking at the two of them communicate is terrible, like looking at a man being tortured by drilling his skull open while blasting pop music at full volume at the same time.
    0x0FEB, // I'm afraid I have no idea if there is any plywood in the school, let alone where it would be if there was any.
    0x105A, // Awww… what should I do?
    0x1074, // Perhaps try to find Mr. Nomiya? I'm quite sure he would know where to find everything you need.
    0x10D4, // You'd have to pry them from his cold, dead hands, but that's a different matter.
    0x1125, // Aaaah! I don't have time! We are so busy!
    0x114F, // She holds her head with both of her hands, looking as despairing as it's possible for a person like her. Without even noticing, she crumples the note she's holding against her hair.
    0x1205, // I shouldn't even be fetching these things, there is so much to do and we are falling behind the schedule!
    0x126F, // Mutou looks at her gravely and then, suddenly smiles. Smiling doesn't really fit his face. I think it'd be better if he didn't.
    0x12EF, // I wonder if you could get some temporary help?
    0x131E, // He switches to staring at me focusedly, with a hard expression, as if trying to say 'go make some friends.'
    0x138A, // …
    0x138E, // Eehhh… I guess I can give you a hand.
    0x13B6, // You can? Thanks, Hicchan, you are really nice!
    0x13E5, // She pauses, does a double take and then points at me with her finger, yelping 'Ah!' and looking very puzzled.
    0x1453, // Come to think of it, what's Hicchan doing here? Class is over, you should be having fun~!
    0x14AD, // We just had a little chat.
    0x14C8, // Oh no! It's not detention is it? Are you in trouble, Hicchan?
    0x1506, // No, I'm not.
    0x1513, // Is Hicchan in trouble, teacher?
    0x1533, // No, he's not.
    0x1541, // Mutou sighs deeply and I feel that I have to help Misha to get her off the teacher's back.
    0x159C, // So what do you need?
    0x15B1, // Here's a list. I can try to find the plywood from somewhere if there's none in the art room.
    0x160E, // She offers me the note she's holding. I take it, hesitating a bit.
    0x1651, // I said I'd help you, but this has no implications on whether I'm joining the council or not.
    0x16AE, // Awww….
    0x16B7, // Still, thanks, Hicchan. Try to be quick, we are in a stall-building streak now, we must hurry hurry hurry!
    0x1722, // She bounces out of the classroom, leaving me and the teacher looking at each other with something that feels like a silent agreement.
    0x17A8, // Well, there you have it, Nakai. You have something to do now.
    0x17E6, // Please don't sound so smug.
    0x1802, // Looking at the list with a number of items ranging from paint to plywood, all written with small, neat handwriting that is undoubtedly Shizune's, I heave a sigh.
    0x18A4, // I'll be going then.
    0x18B8, // Waving the long list limply at the teacher, I exit to the hallway.
