    0x0000, // Lilly and Hanako quickly go about the business of making lunch.
    0x0040, // Before I can even open my small bag of food, Lilly's busying herself with her thermos and teabags as Hanako is setting out both their lunchboxes.
    0x00D2, // So, is this what you meant by coming here almost every day?
    0x010E, // Yes, Hanako and I usually have lunch here. It suits both of us, so we ended up using this room regularly.
    0x0178, // After seeing Hanako's reactions to me over the past couple of days, I can understand why that is a boon. That, and Lilly being able to get some quiet away from her class as well.
    0x022B, // I take my seat last, after Lilly's poured the tea for us and sits down.
    0x0273, // The more time I spend with these two girls, the more I think they're a perfect foil to Misha and Shizune.
    0x02DD, // Even without a voice, Shizune is direct and brash, and Misha seems to get along with everyone. On the other hand, Lilly is soft-spoken and relaxed while Hanako seems to be the shyest girl I've ever met.
    0x03A8, // So, how are you faring in Yamaku, Hisao? You seemed a bit flustered before.
    0x03F4, // Apart from getting lost every now and again, and being crash-tackled outside my classroom? Fine I guess…
    0x045F, // You… you looked pretty hurt before. Are you really… okay?
    0x049D, // For a brief moment, I consider telling Hanako and Lilly about my condition but then, I hold it back.
    0x0502, // I can't tell why, but for some reason I feel uncomfortable talking about it to these relative strangers, even if they have been pretty friendly.
    0x0593, // Yeah, it's nothing. I was just a bit startled.
    0x05C2, // Judging from the two girls' expressions, I don't think that they're buying it. But, in what I assume is their way of respecting my privacy, they don't press the matter.
    0x066B, // I guess that is one of the unwritten rules around here; 'don't ask.' Even if people's conditions are obvious, like Hanako's, there's still bound to be a story involved.
    0x0714, // Everyone has things that they don't feel comfortable speaking about, and I think everyone here recognizes that.
    0x0784, // So, uh… how long have you been in this school? You both seem to know your way around pretty well.
    0x07E8, // Hmm… well, I've been here since the start of high school, but only moved into the dormitories a year ago.
    0x0854, // Hanako joined at the start of high school as well, and moved to the dormitories when she did, if memory serves me right.
    0x08CD, // That's right. Since… high school.
    0x08F1, // So you've known each other since then?
    0x0918, // Since I moved, yes. Hanako lives next door to me, so it's only natural, right?
    0x0967, // R-right.
    0x0970, // Yeah, of course.
    0x0981, // Living next to someone is probably reason enough to befriend them, though I'm guessing that Lilly's blindness played a part in it as well.
    0x0A0C, // I can't imagine Hanako easily making friends with someone who has to deliberately avoid looking at her scars.
    0x0A7A, // With the immediate conversation dried up, we start to eat our lunch.
    0x0ABF, // It isn't long before the bells are signaling the end of the break. Like me, the girls pack up their lunches as efficiently as they set them out.
    0x0B50, // I guess I'd better be off. Are you going to go with Hisao, Hanako?
    0x0B93, // Hanako looks up at me, and for a second I can see that she is considering skipping class, maybe just to avoid walking to the classroom with me.
    0x0C23, // Y-yes.
    0x0C2A, // I don't know what to think of it. Hanako really is delicate to the point of breaking if looked at in the wrong way. It makes me a bit nervous too, but I push the feeling aside, trying to be as natural as I can.
    0x0CFD, // We should hurry then. Class has already started by the sound of it.
    0x0D41, // Lilly gives a nod of farewell as she bends down to take her cane, Hanako and I filing out before her.
    0x0DA7, // We walk quickly down the empty halls to our respective classes.
    0x0DE7, // As we reach the door to Lilly's 3-2 classroom, she turns towards me.
    0x0E2C, // Hisao, thank you for sharing lunch with us today.
    0x0E5E, // My pleasure, Lilly.
    0x0E72, // And with that, we part ways; Lilly entering her classroom and leaving Hanako and me to make off to our own. She's still looking like she wants to run away.
    0x0F0E, // So, do you really want to go back to class now?
    0x0F3E, // Y-yes.
    0x0F45, // Okay then.
    0x0F50, // I feel like I should say something more to her, but it's hard to come up with anything that would be appropriate and safe enough.
    0x0FD2, // And Lilly was right; the more time we spend out here, the more explaining we have to do.
    0x102B, // I open the rear door to the class, and walk in.
    0x105B, // The teacher looks up at me, and opens his mouth to say something.
    0x109D, // However, as Hanako follows me in and closes the door, he simply nods to us and continues his lecture.
    0x1103, // This is the third time that Hanako has had her truancy practically ignored. There's definitely something going on here.
    0x117B, // We make our way to our seats, and I notice that Misha and Shizune are both missing as well.
    0x11D7, // I wonder if it is some form of informal agreement with the staff, or if it's a 'perk' afforded to the unique students of this school?
    0x125D, // Trying to make as little disturbance as I can, I extract the relevant textbooks from my bag and start catching up.
    0x12D0, // The class goes on quietly.
