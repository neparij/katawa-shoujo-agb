    0x010A, // Everyone seems to know where they are going.
    0x0137, // And I still keep thinking that most of them don't look too special for being students at a special school. Then again, neither do I.
    0x01BC, // Does that make me one of them?{w} One of us?
    0x01E9, // …
    0x01ED, // I should go somewhere too, to prevent me from getting lost.
    0x0229, // It's around dinnertime, but I feel tired instead of hungry.
    0x0265, // The weariness in me only grows as I trudge towards the dorms, set a little way apart from the main building complex.
    0x02DA, // There is a garden of sorts between the school and the dorms; shrubbery, flowers and that overbearing smell of fresh cut grass that fills the atmosphere.
    0x0373, // It dawns on my tired mind that the smell feels novel because I haven't been outside at all for so long.
    0x03DB, // The dorm building is big and made of red brick. Like the others, it feels way too pompous for what it is, so I push forward, going inside.
    0x0466, // It takes more time than necessary to fish out the key I was given from my pocket.
    0x04B8, // Room one-one-nine…
    0x04CD, // Despite the ornate exterior, the inside of the dorm is fairly new, functional, and boring.
    0x0528, // Just like in the main building, the halls and doors are wide to accommodate wheelchairs. The same goes for the elevators at the ends of the hallways.
    0x05BE, // I poke my head around the corner of the common room door.
    0x05F8, // Inside a few students are watching the television.
    0x062B, // One nods and gives a quick 'hello' before turning back to the TV.
    0x066D, // Seems that only the girls around here are sociable. I suppose that's perfectly fine with me.
    0x06CA, // I climb the stairs to the upper floor.
    0x06F1, // Here, small corridors branch off from the main hallway.
    0x0729, // Each of these minor halls seems to have a toilet and shower, as well as four rooms.
    0x077D, // About halfway down the hall, I spy room 119.
    0x07AA, // The name plates on the rooms adjacent to mine are blank. I guess there are just two of us here.
    0x080A, // Light shines from below the door of room 117, so I knock lightly.
    0x084C, // Hello, is anyone home?
    0x0863, // From inside, I hear a few movements, then the clicking of way more locks than I thought these doors had. After a moment the door squeaks open.
    0x08F2, // A bespectacled boy is standing in the doorway. He is looking at me very intently through his extremely thick eyeglasses.
    0x096B, // Who is it?
    0x0976, // Blind? No, at least not completely, why would he have eyeglasses if he was?
    0x09C2, // He leans closer to me until our noses are almost touching. His breath stinks of garlic.
    0x0A1A, // Hisao Nakai… I'm moving into the next room. I thought I should introduce my…
    0x0A6B, // His face suddenly brightens in realization, and he stands back upright, thrusting his hand out in a smiling greeting, almost straight to my diaphragm.
    0x0B02, // Oh, 'sup dude? The name's Kenji.
    0x0B23, // Ah, hi.
    0x0B2B, // I take Kenji's sweaty hand and shake it, still a little rattled by the sudden change of attitude and vehement welcome.
    0x0BA2, // There were some suspicious-looking people going in and out of your room earlier.
    0x0BF3, // It was probably my parents.
    0x0C0F, // Your parents? You sure? 'Cause they could've been some other people, too. You can't judge a book by its cover.
    0x0C7E, // His out-of-place proverb is left hanging between us awkwardly as I try to think of some way to respond.
    0x0CE6, // I'd say the chances are high enough.
    0x0D0B, // He shudders and makes some exaggerated hand gestures.
    0x0D41, // You're a brave man, Hisao.
    0x0D5C, // Me, I don't think I could trust the chances.
    0x0D89, // The only one I trust is myself.
    0x0DA9, // Does that mean I shouldn't get to know you, either?
    0x0DDD, // He thinks about this for a while.
    0x0DFF, // A wise decision.
    0x0E10, // Damn, you are smarter than you look.
    0x0E35, // Probably.
    0x0E3F, // What do you look like? I hope not smart.
    0x0E68, // He squints his eyes and leans closer again, but I lean backwards to dodge it.
    0x0EB6, // Never mind, it doesn't matter.
    0x0ED5, // With that, he turns, fumbles around for a moment in search of the door handle,{w=0.3}{nw}
    0x0F2F, // and shuts the door behind him.
    0x0F4E, // I slide the key into the lock of the door marked 119.
    0x0F84, // Bleak beige walls, white linen, a desk made of some type of light wood. Ugly curtains.
    0x0FDB, // It's no one's room; impersonal, like my hospital room was.
    0x1016, // My bags are sitting at the foot of my bed, looking a lot emptier than they did this morning.
    0x1073, // The closet is sitting open, stocked with my clothes.
    0x10A8, // Also, it seems that there are a number of school uniforms hanging there as well.
    0x10F9, // A note is pinned to the sleeve of one of the shirts.
    0x112E, // Well, at least I don't have to worry about unpacking.
    0x1164, // I kind of hoped I would have, then there would be something to do.
    0x11A7, // It's still too early.
    0x11BD, // I put the note down on the desktop and lie down on the bed, feeling drained.
    0x120A, // Lying there makes me want to read something, but I have nothing with me.
    0x1253, // I wonder if the hospital conditioned me for wanting to read whenever I have nothing to do.
    0x12AE, // The restless urge just keeps growing until I have to stand up.
    0x12ED, // Maybe it's stress or something.
    0x130D, // I was pretty nervous about it before coming and for the entire day today too. I still am, I think.
    0x1370, // Damn, I have to distract myself somehow, so I won't be this unnatural all the time.
    0x13C4, // Tomorrow, I'll go borrow some books from the library.
    0x13FA, // Yeah, I'll do that.
    0x140E, // But for now…
    0x141D, // The bottles of medications neatly arranged on my night table catch my eye.
    0x1468, // I pick up one and shake it just to hear the contents rattle inside, and then read the glued-on pharmacy label.
    0x14D7, // It doesn't really say that, but it could just as well.
    0x150E, // It's kinda twisted, having your life depend on chemicals like this. I resent it a little, but what choice do I have?
    0x1583, // With a sigh, I begin my new daily ritual of taking the right number of pills from each bottle, being careful to check the correct dosages.
    0x160E, // …
    0x1612, // I lie down again, feeling hollow and uncertain, and after that I keep staring at the blank, unfamiliar ceiling for a long time.
    0x1692, // It doesn't start looking any more familiar, not even after darkness falls and long shadows draw across my room like fingers.
    0x170F, // The sheets feel slightly more comfortable, warm and nest-like against the chill that passes for room temperature here.
    0x1786, // Soon the lighter shade of darkness that is the ceiling looks like every ceiling does at night, and it becomes the only thing I recognize any more.
    0x1819, // The night beckons me to sleep, and I feel the coldness of unfamiliarity and fear creeping up my spine once again.
    0x188B, // I keep drifting further away from the world I knew.
