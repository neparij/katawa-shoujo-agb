    0x0000, // The library seems as good a place as any to go. Hanako looked as if she was taken pretty off-guard by Lilly leaving, so she might want someone to talk to.
    0x009B, // Slinging my bag over my shoulder, I make my way out of the classroom.
    0x00E1, // I walk down the hallway to the library, past a multitude of closed doors.
    0x012B, // Through each one the sound of furious rehearsal can be heard. Rock music blares out of one door, almost as loud as a concert.
    0x01A9, // I guess that's one of the advantages of a private school; there are actually enough rooms to go around at a time like this.
    0x0225, // And, when I think about it, the grounds and buildings of the school are kept in pretty good condition. That can't be too cheap.
    0x02A5, // I've heard that this place has some pretty serious benefactors.
    0x02E5, // The walls of the library only partially insulate the noise of the festival preparations, but they're the only sounds to be heard.
    0x0367, // Not a soul stirs here, with everyone apparently enjoying the weather outside or working on festival events.
    0x03D3, // Yuuko isn't here either. Maybe she doesn't work on Saturdays.
    0x0411, // I quietly walk through the library, now fairly familiar with its layout. I head to the back, where Hanako's private little corner is.
    0x0497, // I run my hand along the spines of the books on the way through, feeling the individual texture of each as I glance across the titles.
    0x051D, // I used to do this all the time at the library at the hospital. Some things never change, I guess.
    0x057F, // Like the smell of a library. No matter how much care you take, the paper in books is always going to degrade with time.
    0x05F7, // Probably, no matter which library you go into, anywhere in the world, it must have that same, musty smell.
    0x0662, // I find something that looks light enough to read without any major thought involved then look for Hanako in the reading area.
    0x06E0, // Once again, she is sitting on a beanbag with her back to a bookshelf. Reading the same book she'd had in the classroom, she's slowly making her way through the pages.
    0x0787, // Unlike last time I saw her here, I quietly take a seat in a beanbag. The noise is enough to catch her attention, but not startle her.
    0x080D, // This delicate routine that must be followed each and every time I try to talk to her almost feels like hunting game.
    0x0882, // Is that the same book as before?
    0x08A3, // Y-yes… I'm almost finished…
    0x08C3, // Cool.
    0x08C9, // I wonder if I should…
    0x08E1, // Do you mind if I borrow it when you're finished?
    0x0912, // My mouth is faster than my mind, it seems.
    0x093D, // S-sure… you m-may not like it but…
    0x0964, // I'm sure it can't be that bad. After all, you've stuck with it, haven't you?
    0x09B1, // I-I guess.
    0x09BC, // I settle into my beanbag and set about reading my own book that had been buried in my bag.
    0x0A17, // It's a light novel about pirates. To be honest I'm barely skimming over the words, having chosen the book merely because it belongs to a different genre than I usually read.
    0x0AC5, // Finding it hard to muster enough enthusiasm to finish the book, and noting that I've inadvertently distracted Hanako quite a bit, I decide to try and make conversation.
    0x0B6E, // So, I see Lilly left without you?
    0x0B90, // She nods before taking her eyes off her book. She must have been really into it after all.
    0x0BEB, // Lilly said she had to go and… meet someone…
    0x0C1B, // Oh?
    0x0C1F, // A-Akira. Her sister…
    0x0C36, // Sister? I haven't heard her talk about her family…
    0x0C6B, // She… she and Akira used to live together.
    0x0C97, // I thought all the students lived in the dorms?
    0x0CC6, // T-they… I mean we… don't have to.
    0x0CEC, // But it's easier, right? I mean, there's food here and you're close to school… I don't think I've ever been to class on time so often in my life.
    0x0D7F, // Her badly hidden smile proves quite rewarding.
    0x0DAE, // In the back of my mind I know I have a bit of homework to catch up on, but it's quite comfortable in here. No one can find me and force me into working for their pet project, either.
    0x0E65, // Though now that I'm thinking about the festival, another question comes up…
    0x0EB3, // Hey, Hanako, what are you doing for the festival?
    0x0EE5, // For a split second I think that Hanako is about to throw her book in the air from shock.
    0x0F3E, // S-sorry…?
    0x0F4A, // I was just asking what you're doing for the festival tomorrow. Anything planned?
    0x0F9B, // I… I don't know.
    0x0FAE, // Hanako answers in the way that people do when they don't want you to ask any more questions. I take it large crowds and loud music aren't really her 'thing.'
    0x104C, // Oh, okay.
    0x1056, // Change the subject, change the subject…
    0x1080, // So, what's Lilly's sister like?
    0x10A0, // She… she's nice. She's pretty like Lilly, but she dresses… business-like…
    0x10F0, // Business-like?
    0x10FF, // She… she's always wearing a suit…
    0x1125, // Ah, I see. And that makes her less pretty somehow?
    0x1158, // Hanako gives an embarrassed shake of her head.
    0x1187, // N-no… just… different.
    0x11A2, // I'll admit it, this has got me intrigued. To hear Hanako talk about someone other than Lilly is a first, and to be complimentary about it too…
    0x1233, // But as I try to picture this mystery sister, all I can think of is Lilly in a suit. And I can't imagine that not being attractive. Not at all.
    0x12C2, // Well, one day you'll have to introduce me to her.
    0x12F4, // O-okay.
    0x12FC, // Our brief conversation ends as abruptly as it started, and we both return to our novels.
    0x1355, // The passage of time is marked only by the gradual movement of the patch of light cast through the window.
    0x13BF, // Slowly, the noises from the various rehearsals in the building fade out and die as students start to get hungry and tired.
    0x143A, // Just thinking about that makes my stomach start to turn knots around itself. I think it's time to head back.
    0x14A7, // Do you think Lilly would be back by now? I think I might head back to my dorm. I'm pretty tired from this week.
    0x1517, // And not a word of that is a lie. Moving to a new school as it ramps up for a major event has been taxing, to say the least.
    0x1593, // I can feel myself nodding off as I read my book.
    0x15C4, // O-okay. I… I might stay here a little longer.
    0x15F4, // Looking at Hanako's book, I can see that she is only a few pages away from completing it.
    0x164E, // For a moment I consider hanging around until she finishes, but once again my stomach turns, emitting a gurgling sound.
    0x16C5, // Sure thing. Well I'm going to head off before it gets dark. I'll see you around, okay?
    0x171C, // O-okay. See you, Hisao.
    0x1734, // Later.
    0x173B, // H-Hisao?
    0x1744, // Hmm?
    0x1749, // T-thank you. F-for hanging out with me.
    0x1771, // I can see how hard it was for her to get that simple sentence out of her mouth. It leaves me hanging for a moment.
    0x17E4, // So. There is someone in this school who is even lonelier than me. Maybe lonely is a wrong word, I haven't been lacking company for this first week, but I've still managed to feel somewhat alone and detached.
    0x18B4, // Maybe lonely is a wrong word for Hanako too, she has Lilly after all, doesn't she?
    0x1907, // I realize I've been standing there far too long without answering, and pull off a flawless, not too exaggerated smile.
    0x197E, // You're welcome.
    0x198E, // Good night, Hanako.
    0x19A2, // N-night.
    0x19AB, // I leave her to finish her book and head back to the dorms and the promise of food…
