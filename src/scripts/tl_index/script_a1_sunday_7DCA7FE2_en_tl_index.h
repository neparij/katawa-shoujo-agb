    0x0000, // Lilly doesn't look impressed at all, and I can't really blame her.
    0x0043, // On top of her issues with her stall, she still seems to be worried about Hanako.
    0x0094, // I can't really help her with the former, so I guess the only way I can help is by trying to take her mind off our shy mutual friend.
    0x0119, // Placing the bowl back on the counter, I call out to Lilly.
    0x0154, // Hey, Lilly, don't worry about Hanako. I'll go find her and hang out with her, okay?
    0x01A8, // I can see Lilly's relief plainly written across her face.
    0x01E2, // Thanks Hisao. And if you see anyone from my class, can you tell them to come back here please?
    0x0241, // Will do. Have a good one. And make sure you take a break, okay?
    0x0281, // I will if I can. See you later, Hisao.
    0x02A8, // I leave Lilly in the stall and head out in search of Hanako.
    0x02E5, // In a way, I feel bad for leaving her with the crowds, but even though she was clearly under pressure, I can't help but think that she is enjoying herself.
    0x0380, // The halls are packed with swaying crowds meandering throughout the festival.
    0x03CD, // If there's one thing I know about Hanako, it's that she's not going to be anywhere near this.
    0x042B, // And with the students showing their friends and family their dorms, I doubt she'll be there either.
    0x048F, // Following blind intuition, I move against the grain of the crowd.
    0x04D1, // Thankfully, this crowd seems to be slightly less festive than your usual festival crowd; I assume this is out of consideration for the student body.
    0x0566, // As I force my way through the masses, it doesn't take long for them to thin down into nothingness.
    0x05C9, // This is not surprising, since I am standing before the library.
    0x0609, // Even the most eager of students don't bother to show anyone this section of the school.
    0x0661, // As I enter the library, the noise of the festival fades into a dull background noise, and soon I am in the reading area at the rear of the room.
    0x06F2, // Behind one of the partitioned desks I see the top of a head, with straight, dark hair catching my eye.
    0x0759, // Hey, Hanako. I had a feeling I'd find you here…
    0x078B, // The head jumps a little in shock before slowly peeping over the partition.
    0x07D6, // H-Hisao?
    0x07DF, // Hey. Lilly's pretty busy, so she sent me to find you.
    0x0815, // O-oh. Do you want to sit down?
    0x0834, // Actually, I am feeling a little hungry. Would you like to get something to eat from one of the stands?
    0x089B, // Um… I… I brought some food so…
    0x08C0, // I shouldn't be surprised, but it was worth a try. Expecting her to go outside today was a long shot.
    0x0925, // How about we eat in the tea room? I passed by it on the way here, and no one was around.
    0x097E, // We can make some food there, and it'll be a little more comfortable. What do you say?
    0x09D4, // S-sure. Let's go.
    0x09E6, // Hanako closes her book and puts it away with deliberate, practiced movements.
    0x0A34, // Good to go?
    0x0A40, // Y…yeah.
    0x0A4A, // We walk side-by-side from the library to the tea room.
    0x0A81, // As expected, there is barely a soul around.
    0x0AAD, // If it weren't for the murmurs through the walls, you wouldn't tell that there was a huge festival going on outside.
    0x0B21, // Hanako carries her bag in both hands and focuses on just the floor ahead of her.
    0x0B72, // Every now and again, she seems to break her pace a little and steps in slightly shorter paces.
    0x0BD1, // The first time it happened, I gave it no mind, but I soon notice that she does it on a regular basis.
    0x0C37, // Are you all right?
    0x0C4A, // She stops dead in her tracks.
    0x0C68, // W-what?
    0x0C70, // I dunno… it looked like you were tripping or something…
    0x0CAC, // A pink blush rises into her cheeks as her gaze returns to the floor.
    0x0CF1, // It… it's nothing.
    0x0D05, // You know, when you say 'nothing' like that, people are inspired to ask further questions.
    0x0D5F, // For a second I don't think she is going to answer.
    0x0D92, // Prepared to leave it be, I almost set off walking again, when…
    0x0DD3, // It's a… a game.
    0x0DE5, // Game?
    0x0DEB, // Do you… see the floor here?
    0x0E09, // What a bizarre question. The floor looks just like any other floor; covered in those tiles made up from squares of linoleum.
    0x0E86, // Nothing noteworthy.
    0x0E9A, // Well, yes. What about it?
    0x0EB4, // Sometimes… when there's no one around… I only step on the darker ones…
    0x0F01, // Hanako's voice trails off as her explanation continues, until I can barely hear her voice over the roaring silence of the empty hall.
    0x0F87, // Darker ones?
    0x0F94, // Shuffling her feet, Hanako points the toe of her shoe at a tile that is barely a shade darker than the others.
    0x1003, // L-like these ones.
    0x1016, // Oh, right, so these ones are no good?
    0x103C, // I point out a nearby tile.
    0x1057, // Y-yeah. Something… something like that.
    0x1081, // Oh, I see. Do you play this game a lot?
    0x10A9, // Hanako shakes her head.
    0x10C1, // Just when the halls are empty?
    0x10E0, // She nods.
    0x10EA, // Well then, no point in stopping, I'm beginning to get really hungry.
    0x112F, // She nods again, this time with a little more enthusiasm.
    0x1168, // Well then, let's go.
    0x117D, // We set off down the hall, and this time I notice that Hanako is paying a little less attention to the floor.
    0x11EA, // I wonder; just how lonely does someone have to be to come up with a game like that?
    0x123E, // But, before I realize what I'm doing, I find myself trying to aim each step so it lands on the correct tiles.
    0x12AC, // The noise of the festival is slightly louder inside the tea room, but the breeze coming through the open window makes it worth it.
    0x132F, // Without thinking, I walk to the windowsill and inhale deeply. I sometimes forget how clean the air is here compared to back home.
    0x13B1, // Do… would you like some tea?
    0x13D0, // That would be great, thanks.
    0x13ED, // It occurs to me that this is the first time I've been alone with Hanako without her trying to be somewhere else.
    0x145E, // Turning from the window, I watch as she makes a simple pot of tea and arranges some sandwiches onto a plate.
    0x14CB, // I've seen her do this before a number of times, but this time she seems slightly different.
    0x1527, // It's like she's…{w} calm.
    0x1543, // Eventually she places the small tray on the table and pours two cups of tea.
    0x1590, // The fresh scent of brewed tea mingles with the breeze, and for a second I feel like I'm the only one in the world.
    0x1603, // I think I know why you like this room now.
    0x162E, // Um… I don't know what you mean.
    0x1650, // Well, there are quite a few people out there, but in here it's like another world.
    0x16A3, // You can pretend that there's no one around for miles.
    0x16D9, // Y-you're right.
    0x16E9, // It's like the world has forgotten this room.
    0x1716, // And b-because of that, you can forget about the outside.
    0x174F, // That would be appealing in some cases.
    0x1776, // As far as I can tell, conventional bullying doesn't exist in this school.
    0x17C0, // But then again, I haven't seen a single person talk to Hanako besides Lilly.
    0x180D, // If you're ignored by the world, a place where you can forget its existence would hold a special appeal.
    0x1875, // That's a good point. It's like this room gives you some kind of complete freedom.
    0x18C7, // Y-yeah.
    0x18CF, // Say… do you play chess?
    0x18E9, // Chess? I've played it a bit, I guess.
    0x190F, // I take it you've played before?
    0x192F, // A little…
    0x193B, // Without saying anything more, Hanako moves to one of the cupboards and digs out a small chess set.
    0x199E, // Do… do you want…
    0x19B3, // Sure, why not?
    0x19C2, // I cut her off, but she doesn't seem to mind it.
    0x19F2, // We arrange the pieces, and before long we are sending pawns charging to their inevitable fates.
    0x1A52, // I take my time and intently examine each move and its consequences, nostalgia for the game taking second place to the matters at hand.
    0x1AD9, // For a time the game is a lengthy battle of attrition, but I spot an opening and tear a line in her defense.
    0x1B45, // A few moves later, her king is cornered by several of my pieces.
    0x1B86, // Checkmate.
    0x1B91, // You're not bad at this, are you?
    0x1BB2, // An honest appraisal. Her technique is pretty good, but several times I was able to exploit her lack of prediction.
    0x1C25, // I pick up a piece and examine it. It looks relatively new, yet worn for its age.
    0x1C76, // I… I guess not.
    0x1C88, // Does Lilly play?
    0x1C99, // The absence of Hanako's answer causes me to think about my question.
    0x1CDE, // A… A bit…
    0x1CEC, // T-this is the first time I've played against someone… other than her, or…
    0x1D3A, // Or…?
    0x1D41, // She cuts herself off abruptly, leaving the answer hanging in the air. Someone she knew before coming to Yamaku, maybe.
    0x1DB8, // Well then, I'm honored to have played against you.
    0x1DEB, // Um… can we play again?
    0x1E04, // She asks as if she were asking me to cut off my own hands. The spirit of competition's gotten into her?
    0x1E6C, // Sure. Though don't expect me to go easy on you this time…
    0x1EA8, // Not that I was before, mind. She seems to appreciate the competitive tone.
    0x1EF3, // S… same here…
