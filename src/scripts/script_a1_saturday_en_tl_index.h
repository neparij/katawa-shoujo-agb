    0x0000, // The students roll into class for the Saturday morning session, each and every one of them sporting the tired eyes of people who have worked through the night.
    0x009F, // With only a day left to prepare, I suppose it's not so surprising. Thankfully, we only have to suffer through classes until the lunch break, and then our time is our own.
    0x014A, // Mutou lurches into class in a tired stagger. I suppose students aren't the only people here that enjoy their late Friday nights.
    0x01CB, // Without saying a word, he scrawls some page and question numbers on the board and slumps down at his desk.
    0x0236, // It's completely atypical behavior for him, but it appears that no one in the class is going to call him out on it.
    0x02A9, // Wordlessly, the students shuffle their textbooks into position and get to work. Not wanting to break the trend, I do the same.
    0x0328, // Fatigue has made the class antisocial; not a peep is heard among the ruffling papers.
    0x037E, // That can partly be attributed to the two empty seats beside me. For some reason Misha and Shizune aren't present; probably doing council work for the festival.
    0x041E, // It's very quiet without Misha present.
    0x0445, // I wonder if she was born as rowdy as she is, or if she is 'making up' for Shizune's lack of voice.
    0x04A8, // Nakai, can I speak to you for a moment?
    0x04D0, // I'm so engrossed in thinking about Misha that I don't even notice Mutou approaching my desk.
    0x052D, // Sure… what's this about?
    0x0548, // It's probably better if we speak outside the classroom…
    0x0582, // Something about this doesn't sound too good, but I stand up and follow him out into the hallway.
    0x05E3, // Mutou stands in the hallway, scratching his head as he works out what he is trying to say. Not knowing what's going on, I wait silently.
    0x066C, // So then, onto my next question; how are you finding your studies? I understand you were laid up for a while. We're not too far ahead, are we?
    0x06FA, // I don't really think so. I tried to keep up when I was in the hospital, so it hasn't been too hard.
    0x075E, // Mutou taps his chin and raises an eyebrow as he absorbs this information.
    0x07A8, // Is that so… I suppose there are still students out there who realize the importance of learning…
    0x080D, // I wouldn't go that far, I was only trying to keep myself occupied in my little life-support prison.
    0x0871, // Well, yeah. You've got to keep up with these things, right?
    0x08AD, // That's exactly it. One wrong move in this world and you're left behind, right?
    0x08FC, // Er, right. Wouldn't want that to happen.
    0x0925, // No, no you wouldn't. Every week there's a new scientific discovery. Most of them mean nothing to the layperson, but any one of them could be the key to the Next Big Thing.
    0x09D1, // I'll keep that in mind…
    0x09EB, // It's obvious that Mutou's Serious Talk is over, and he's gone back to his standard, slightly scatterbrained approach to life.
    0x0A69, // I think, in hindsight, that I prefer him this way. He's slightly more predictable in his unpredictability.
    0x0AD4, // Well then, I think that's all I really had to say. Let's get back inside, shall we?
    0x0B28, // My relief at that suggestion is insurmountable.
    0x0B58, // Sure. You're the boss, right?
    0x0B76, // Mutou pauses for a moment.
    0x0B91, // I don't think any of my students have ever said that to me before.
    0x0BD4, // For an instant I consider replying to this, but something deep within me tells me to shut my mouth and get back into the classroom.
    0x0C58, // A few of the students jump at the sound of the door, rapidly trying to pretend that they are working on the questions on the board.
    0x0CDC, // Some don't even bother, their heads slumped on the desk as they nap. Thankfully, it would appear that Mutou does not even notice them.
    0x0D63, // He returns to his desk and retrieves a scientific journal from one of the drawers. I guess I got to him there.
    0x0DD2, // The class returns to the near-silence that Mutou and I left it in before our chat.
    0x0E25, // Mixed feelings of tiredness and anticipation buzz around the room. Everyone here is either waiting for a chance to rest or the chance to get their last-minute preparations underway.
    0x0EDB, // The clock on the wall slowly ticks the remaining class time away, until finally the bells cry out, ending the torment.
    0x0F52, // Before you all leave, I expect the answers for those problems by Monday.
    0x0F9B, // The class sighs as one, instantly regretting slacking off, but still acutely aware of the more pressing issues at hand.
    0x1013, // The classroom empties in a blink as everyone rushes to their last-minute festival preparations.
    0x1073, // I stay behind and try to quickly finish the questions so I don't have to bother with it over the rest of the weekend, with the festival and all tomorrow.
    0x110D, // Apart from me, Hanako is the only one left, obviously waiting for Lilly.
    0x1156, // It's weird that Lilly comes all the way to our classroom to pick her up. I expect that moving around is at least nominally harder for her than it is for Hanako.
    0x11F7, // But it's none of my business, and I naturally don't ask about it from Hanako.
    0x1245, // Despite the relative proximity of our seats, neither tries to strike up a conversation about that or anything else either, so an oppressive silence falls upon the classroom.
    0x12F3, // Time passes in silence. It's probably just fifteen minutes or so but it feels longer. I turn pages of my notebook. Hanako turns pages of the novel she's reading.
    0x1395, // My pencil lead splinters against the paper just when I was about to finish a paragraph.
    0x13ED, // The sounds of my irritated sigh and subsequent fumbling around for a sharpener feel like they're breaking the mood in the classroom.
    0x1472, // Hanako keeps her eyes firmly away from my direction.
    0x14A7, // Before long, Lilly's tall figure appears in the doorway.
    0x14E0, // Hanako?
    0x14E8, // Her name is all it takes to make Hanako jump up from her desk and run to Lilly.
    0x1538, // They talk quietly for a moment, but it isn't long before Lilly leaves down the hall and Hanako idles back into the classroom, taking her seat once again.
    0x15D2, // I watch Hanako out of the corner of my eye out of sheer curiosity at the idea that the two would be separated.
    0x1641, // For a couple of minutes, she does nothing but sit with her chin in her hand, staring at the desk dejectedly.
    0x16AE, // The boredom evidently becomes too much for her though, her slender frame reaching into her bag and pulling out a small book.
    0x172B, // Come to think of it, that isn't the one I saw her reading at the library. She must be quite a fast reader to get through them at this rate.
    0x17B7, // After about ten minutes of restlessly shuffling in her seat and trying to read, Hanako closes her book and leaves too.
    0x182E, // As should I, since the assignment is all but finished and there is nothing else to do in the classroom.
    0x1896, // Not that I have anything to do anywhere else either.
    0x18CB, // The school is a beehive of activity but nobody pays me any heed.
    0x190C, // I saunter past classrooms filled with students frantically doing this and that, buzzing around like little worker bees.
    0x1984, // You wouldn't guess the school day is over.
    0x19AF, // It's a bit quieter outside, but not by much.
    0x19DC, // People zip by, left and right, hurrying as quickly as they can; busy and energetic.
    0x1A30, // I feel the opposite. The midday sun seems to be draining all the spirit out of my body, making it feel limp all over.
    0x1AA6, // Warm, soft air flows inside my shirt, feeling like a cushion.
    0x1AE4, // I yawn lazily, thinking about what I'd do.
    0x1B0F, // I'll drop off my books at the dorms first, and then… something I haven't decided yet.
    0x1B67, // Maybe Kenji is in his room.
    0x1B83, // On the way to dorms, I spot Emi coming my way, running despite not having those weird running prosthetics on. I wave at her and she skids to a stop.
    0x1C18, // Yo, Hisao!
    0x1C23, // Spatters of white and green paint adorn her nose and chin respectively, but her smile is wide, as it seems it always is.
    0x1C9C, // She leans closer to me, amplifying the feeling she is examining me.
    0x1CE0, // Whatchadoin'?
    0x1CEE, // Nothing, really. I don't have anything to do for the festival and everyone else seems to be doing something important.
    0x1D65, // That's perfect! Then you can help me and Rin!
    0x1D93, // With the festival preparations? Eeeh, I'm not sure if I would be of much help.
    0x1DE2, // That's fine! I'm not much help either!
    0x1E09, // Emi grabs my wrist and starts dragging me back inside the school quite forcefully.
    0x1E5C, // Even her walking speed is more like jogging, making me stumble over myself simply trying to keep up.
    0x1EC1, // The stairs slow Emi down a little bit. Maybe it's hard to climb with her legs, or maybe she's finally run out of breath.
    0x1F3A, // We go all the way back to the third floor and to the seniors' hallway, ending up where I left five minutes ago. I could just as well have stayed here waiting for Emi, had I known.
    0x1FEE, // So are you… is Rin working on that mural, still?
    0x2021, // That's right! She needs all kinds of paints and brushes and stuff, so I went to get them from the art classroom.
    0x2092, // And you need me to help with that.
    0x20B5, // Well… Rin told me you had already helped her so I thought you wouldn't mind.
    0x2104, // I see.
    0x210B, // So thanks to Emi's flaky logic, here I am again, collecting stuff from the art classroom for other people.
    0x2176, // The room is empty apart from ourselves and the lonely specks of dust floating in the air. Emi skips straight away to the back wall, digging out a tiny, crumpled piece of paper from her pocket.
    0x2237, // While she tries to make sense of the scrawled handwriting, I take a closer look at the materials lying around here.
    0x22AB, // Dozens of paint cans and bottles are arranged on the shelves in a most unorganized fashion.
    0x2307, // Some look like they have been left there for several decades; relics of previous art club generations.
    0x236E, // Next to the heavy stacks of neatly piled drawing paper are boxes full of different-sized brushes and unsorted crayons.
    0x23E5, // The smells of paint, turpentine and fresh paper float in the stale air, mixing in my nostrils to form that unmistakable scent of art.
    0x246B, // Emi studies her notes, comparing them to markings on the various paint cans, and passes them to me as she finds the correct matches.
    0x24F0, // She stretches her neck to look on the topmost shelf, but it's not quite enough.
    0x2540, // Her eye level stays below the shelf no matter what she does. Emi gives up and just looks up to the shelf longingly, like a child at a toy store, huffing in annoyance.
    0x25E7, // After a moment of building anger, she starts jumping up and down, apparently trying to speed-read the labels during the fraction of a second she can see them, and catch what she can.
    0x269E, // It's no surprise that she fails miserably, and almost manages to bring the entire shelf crashing down.
    0x2705, // Now I see why me lending a hand here would be useful.
    0x273B, // Come on, let me do that. You can't jump high enough, and I don't want you to hurt yourself trying.
    0x279E, // Also, I'm like twice your height.
    0x27C0, // You are not!
    0x27CD, // She turns around, flaring scorn, flushed cheeks and all.
    0x2806, // Just kidding, just kidding. Anyway, I'll look up there, okay?
    0x2844, // She glares at me one more time, but can't come up with a retort. With a grudging 'hmph,' turns her back to me.
    0x28B3, // So I begin scrounging around the top shelf for paint while below, Emi crouches to scavenge what she can from the cupboards.
    0x292F, // I shake my head a little, after double-checking to ensure she can't see me do so.
    0x2981, // Emi having a complex about her height was a surprise; I wouldn't have joked about it otherwise.
    0x29E1, // She seems easygoing, but I guess everyone has their weak spots.
    0x2A21, // Only after we have almost all the items collected and spread out on a desk like a treasure hunter's spoils do I realize that it wasn't necessarily the height jab that got her riled up.
    0x2ADA, // She might not like to be told that she can't do something. Like jump.
    0x2B20, // But Emi herself seems to have forgotten all about it already. Quick to anger, quick to forgive… is she that type of person?
    0x2B9E, // At least she doesn't seem to have taken anything to heart, as she chatters away happily while we pick up the rest of the items and then make our way back to Rin.
    0x2C40, // I chivalrously carry the bulk of the materials as we make our way towards the dormitories.
    0x2C9B, // Rin is really stressed about getting her painting done. It's her own fault though; she should've started earlier.
    0x2D0D, // Is she going to make it?
    0x2D26, // No idea. It looks good to me, but with Rin, you never know what's going on.
    0x2D72, // I found her this morning lying in front of the dorm in fetal position. She hadn't slept all night. I can't believe that the night nurses hadn't found her.
    0x2E0D, // And now she's painting again like crazy.
    0x2E36, // Yeah, I've… noticed that she comes off as kinda… unhinged. So to speak.
    0x2E82, // Emi giggles at that, as well as at my likely too-obvious awkwardness.
    0x2EC8, // I don't mind it. She's just a little weird sometimes.
    0x2EFE, // On that I can agree with her. Unlike me, Emi seems to be cool with Rin's… whatever it is that feels so off about her.
    0x2F76, // Still, they don't feel close like Misha and Shizune do. With them working as a single entity sometimes, it's hard to say where one ends and the other begins.
    0x3014, // Even though they're so different, just like Emi and Rin are.
    0x3051, // And Rin is the most different of them all, different from anyone else I've met.
    0x30A1, // Yeah, I guess she's a very… unique person.
    0x30CE, // I return to that word again, as if it encompasses Rin's personality by itself, but really it's just a substitute for a lengthy description of her oddities.
    0x316A, // Emi giggles as I grasp about for a properly descriptive word.
    0x31A8, // She's just weird.
    0x31BA, // You know, earlier, she just spent half an hour sitting on her box.
    0x31FD, // And stared at her toes.
    0x3215, // She giggles again in a way that makes me think she doesn't know what's funny about it, it just is.
    0x3278, // All that time.
    0x3287, // The working area is a mess, but the mural itself has taken over even more of the wall since I last saw it.
    0x32F2, // The disfigured human figures have been mostly colored in tones of red, pink, and orange; weird, imaginary… things populating the spaces between.
    0x3385, // It looks… nice. I can't think of any word that would describe the work concisely and comprehensively so I settle myself on a nondescript 'nice.'
    0x3418, // But honestly, it seems that the area around the wall becomes untidier at the same rate as the mural progresses.
    0x3488, // The ground is littered with dozens of paint cans, various art supplies and empty soda bottles.
    0x34E7, // Rin herself is in the center of this chaos, standing there looking very cozy as if she was a natural part of the scene.
    0x355F, // Her pant legs have been rolled up to her knees, exposing her thin legs which sport a drying spectrum of war paintings, similar to those on Emi's face.
    0x35F6, // Emi sprints to Rin ahead of me and gleefully jumps in front of her.
    0x363A, // I'm back!
    0x3644, // That was fast. Did you run in the corridors again?
    0x3677, // Hisao helped me.
    0x3688, // Emi points victoriously at me.
    0x36A7, // Rin turns around following Emi's finger with her eyes, looking at my general direction.
    0x36FF, // She nods absentmindedly at me. She looks like she hasn't slept since last night: a vacant, glazed stare that's focused slightly off me, and movements like in a slow-motion movie.
    0x37B2, // Hello, Hisao. Thank you for the help.
    0x37D8, // Don't mention it.
    0x37EA, // I just did.
    0x37F6, // Never mind.
    0x3802, // Looks like you've made progress. Looking good, as far as I can tell.
    0x3847, // But now you get more bad luck.
    0x3866, // I know, but I'm willing to take the risk.
    0x3890, // That's a very nice thing to say. For me, of course. Not for you.
    0x38D1, // This is why artists are always unlucky. They have to constantly look at their unfinished paintings.
    0x3935, // So artists can't find romance, their favorite TV shows are canceled, or they die young because of an unspecified disease. It's a deep and mysterious law of the universe.
    0x39DF, // Unless they are blind.
    0x39F6, // She considers this for a while, looking like she's going to fall asleep.
    0x3A3F, // There is a boy.
    0x3A4F, // At the art club, you see. Blind boy. So he doesn't. See.
    0x3A88, // He should become an artist. No bad luck, guaranteed.
    0x3ABD, // Don't you think that would be a good idea?
    0x3AE8, // That only blind people should become artists? No, not as such.
    0x3B27, // …
    0x3B2B, // You might have a point.
    0x3B43, // Abandoning this train of thought, she turns again to consider her work and starts humming a tune that I think I recognize, but can't remember the name of.
    0x3BDE, // Emi arranges the supplies we brought and moves a few paint cans around, trying to bring some organization to the scene.
    0x3C56, // Emi, I need the Prussian blue paint.
    0x3C7B, // Which one's Prussian blue…
    0x3C98, // She is staring helplessly at seven or eight cans, each with a different tone of blue.
    0x3CEE, // It's the one with Prussian blue paint in it.
    0x3D1B, // Geez, Rin! You're not helping at all!
    0x3D41, // I look around as well, even though I don't know what Prussian blue looks like, either. I wonder what blue has to do with Prussia.
    0x3DC3, // …Or what Prussia even is. The name sounds vaguely familiar, but I can't place it.
    0x3E17, // While none of the blues looks more Prussian than the others, the small print on the labels is legible enough to determine that none say anything about the contents being Prussian.
    0x3ECB, // There is no Prussian blue here.
    0x3EEB, // Emi heaves a sigh.
    0x3EFE, // I guess I have to go back and get some.
    0x3F26, // I promised to help with our class project, though, so I'll be back a bit later. Can you manage without it for a few hours?
    0x3FA1, // Rin nods, and so Emi leaves.
    0x3FBE, // I stay because I like watching Rin paint, and because I have nothing better to do.
    0x4011, // I sit on a box and pick up today's book from my bag. It's a story about three guys drinking beer for two weeks straight and doing little else.
    0x40A0, // Rin moves from the spot that was in need of the blue and starts slowly working on another.
    0x40FB, // Her foot works the brush steadily against the plastered wall. Layers of paint on top of layers of paint. The mural slowly gains more form.
    0x4186, // I turn the pages at a leisurely pace. In this chapter they are drinking beer at the protagonist's friend's place. In the previous ones it was the protagonist's own apartment.
    0x4235, // It's not a page-turner kind of book, a slice of someone's imaginary life that makes me wonder why it had to be written.
    0x42AD, // Why indeed. The reason for doing something creative… it's something incomprehensible.
    0x4305, // Like why Rin does paintings. It feels like she and Emi are the same, going squarely against their fates as if it's just out of spite.
    0x438B, // Rin even said something like that. 'Do something you can't just because you can.'
    0x43DD, // Is that what she meant? Is that her reason? It might be Emi's, she comes off as quite a headstrong person.
    0x4448, // Rin doesn't give off that kind of an air. Thinking about it, she doesn't give off any kind of air, or maybe a different kind every time I talk with her.
    0x44E1, // Why did she say what she said? Why does she, or anyone at all paint, or draw, or sculpt, or write?
    0x4544, // I've never had much of a creative impulse so I don't think I can really understand it.
    0x459B, // It makes me feel hollow inside.
    0x45BB, // What a grim thought. I can't really decide whether it's true or not, either.
    0x4608, // Am I content being this way? I can't deny I'm feeling a little bit envious of Rin, but I can't really consider it a flaw of any kind.
    0x468E, // I'm myself and she is herself.
    0x46AD, // Still, I do need to find something. Something that could… make me feel a little less lost about myself, instead of just drowning myself in these books as I did in the hospital.
    0x4760, // I can't help but feel disoriented; the new school, lifestyle and people around me contribute heavily to this sensation.
    0x47D8, // I'm trying my best to fit into existing social circles, and most of the people I've met have been really nice.
    0x4847, // It still feels like I'm an outsider, though; like I don't belong.
    0x4889, // I shake the feeling off, realizing that I'm spacing out. I have neither turned a page of the book, nor done anything for Rin.
    0x4907, // She is trying to pour some paint from a big can using only her feet, having not bothered to ask me. Or maybe she did, and I didn't hear it.
    0x4993, // Either way, it looks very unstable.
    0x49B7, // I quickly jump to help her, as it looks like she's about to spill the entire contents of the can all over the pavement.
    0x4A2F, // I take the can from her feet and pour some in the bowl.
    0x4A67, // She doesn't say anything, and neither do I. I catch a glimpse of her eyes, looking silently at me from under her unkempt bangs.
    0x4AE7, // It's an unreadable expression, a perfect poker face, mixed with a hint of something like a mild surprise.
    0x4B51, // I wonder what she is thinking. Maybe she is wondering about what I'm thinking. Maybe nothing.
    0x4BAF, // A penny for your thoughts.
    0x4BCA, // Do you have any pennies with you?
    0x4BEC, // I don't think I do.
    0x4C00, // Then I don't think I will tell. I'm not thinking anything either, so you're in luck. Except now I just did.
    0x4C6C, // She frowns, looking very unsatisfied.
    0x4C92, // It's hard to not think about anything. But it's important.
    0x4CCD, // I'm about to ask why it's important when some old guy walks up to us, looking like he has some business with Rin.
    0x4D3F, // Good afternoon. How's it going?
    0x4D5F, // I can make it.
    0x4D6E, // Rin doesn't take her eyes off the wall and responds so naturally that I can only assume they know each other.
    0x4DDC, // I haven't seen the man before, so I naturally wonder who he might be. Maybe a teacher?
    0x4E33, // His hair has faded to a silvery gray, so much so that it looks artificially dyed. I hope that's not the case.
    0x4EA1, // Small round glasses hang on the bridge of his nose, but it appears he's constantly looking over the lenses, rather than through them.
    0x4F27, // He's studying the mural intently over said glasses.
    0x4F5B, // Good, good.
    0x4F67, // What bold composition you have here!
    0x4F8C, // He moves to inspect the mural closer, talking to himself about it in a way that makes it obvious he wants us to hear it too.
    0x5009, // Very good, very good indeed…
    0x5028, // I don't really know what to make of it but Rin doesn't seem to care much. She's looking around her working space, the various bowls of different tones scattered all over.
    0x50D3, // Hisao.
    0x50DA, // Hmm?
    0x50DF, // A little more of this.
    0x50F6, // Give me a second.
    0x5108, // I pour a 50-50 mix of two paints into the bowl to create more of the same pale pink tone Rin was using to fill up the shape of a man's face.
    0x5195, // Rin watches me doing so, which makes me feel nervous somehow. Her face is so unassuming that it feels she's just waiting for me to do something wrong.
    0x522C, // The man turns to reckon me as well, looking surprised as if he noticed my presence only just now.
    0x528E, // …Maybe he did.
    0x529F, // Why, hello there. Who might you be?
    0x52C3, // Ah, I'm a transfer student to class 3-3. Hisao Nakai. Nice to meet you.
    0x530B, // Mutou's class, eh? Well, I won't hold that against you!
    0x5343, // He laughs very loudly. Obnoxiously loudly. A few small birds take flight from a nearby tree.
    0x53A0, // I'm Shinichi Nomiya, the art teacher.
    0x53C6, // So this is the art teacher. In retrospect, should have guessed that much. He even looks like one, as far as first impressions go.
    0x5448, // How did you come to end up assisting my protégée?
    0x547C, // We need to go get more, then.
    0x549A, // I open my mouth to say that actually, we're not both needed for such a simple task like finding another pot of Prussian Blue, but Emi's already grabbed my arm and started dragging me off.
    0x5556, // I wave to Rin, who doesn't seem to have noticed that the two of us are even leaving.
    0x55AB, // Well, she'll notice when she goes for her Prussian Blue and finds out it's still not there.
    0x5607, // Maybe.
    0x560E, // Probably not, actually.
    0x5626, // While I'm busy thinking of how weird Rin is, Emi's been dragging me back to the art classroom.
    0x5685, // I feel myself starting to run out of breath.
    0x56B2, // What's the rush?
    0x56C3, // Huh?
    0x56C8, // Emi's giving me an appraising look, as if she's trying to figure something out.
    0x5718, // It's just that you seem to be in a hurry.
    0x5742, // I'm not sure I can keep up.
    0x575E, // Comprehension dawns on her face.
    0x577F, // You're not out of breath, are you?
    0x57A2, // There's almost an accusing playfulness to her tone.
    0x57D6, // I'm tempted to deny it, but then I realize that I've been breathing heavy since we stopped.
    0x5832, // Guess it's kind of obvious.
    0x584E, // A little. Not everybody can be in shape, you know.
    0x5881, // Takes all kinds, right?
    0x5899, // Emi frowns. It's not a particularly good frown.
    0x58C9, // Er, that is…
    0x58D8, // I should… get in shape?
    0x58F2, // Not that I hadn't already decided to try for that.
    0x5925, // After that flutter on the track I figure there's a real need to get in some sort of running habit.
    0x5988, // I was, after all, feeling pretty good until I had my false alarm.
    0x59CA, // Well, actually I wasn't. But it was… fun?
    0x59F6, // Meanwhile, my comment seems to have helped Emi come to some sort of a decision.
    0x5A46, // Well, that's it, then.
    0x5A5D, // She gives me a serious look.
    0x5A7A, // You're joining me.
    0x5A8D, // I beg your pardon?
    0x5AA0, // In the mornings.
    0x5AB1, // You and I are now running partners.
    0x5AD5, // I've got a routine all planned out. In fact…
    0x5B04, // She produces a crumpled sheet of paper.
    0x5B2C, // I've got it right here with me.
    0x5B4C, // I take the sheet of paper and give it a once-over.
    0x5B7F, // Times, dates, and laps, all laid out.
    0x5BA5, // A slow increase from just a few laps a day to…
    0x5BD6, // My God, does she expect to have me running marathons?
    0x5C0C, // And where did she find the time to get this all together?
    0x5C46, // And how long has she been planning this, anyway?
    0x5C77, // You've been planning this?
    0x5C92, // A little.
    0x5C9C, // But it's really the nurse's idea!
    0x5CBE, // He told me to keep an eye on you to make sure you exercised like he told you to!
    0x5D0F, // A vast conspiracy?
    0x5D22, // Maybe Kenji's on to something here…
    0x5D48, // This seems a bit much for just 'keeping an eye on me.'
    0x5D7F, // Well, to be honest I've been trying to find a running partner in the mornings for a while now.
    0x5DDE, // My God, Kenji! If you could only see the scheme unfolding!
    0x5E19, // What do you need a partner for, anyway?
    0x5E41, // It's easier to keep up a workout if you're not the only one doing it.
    0x5E87, // Isn't that obvious?
    0x5E9B, // You're less likely to quit if someone else is counting on you to be there, right?
    0x5EED, // I see. And this won't only keep you running, but it'll make sure that I keep running as well.
    0x5F4B, // Meaning that I'll be obeying the nurse…
    0x5F75, // …and I'll be keeping an eye on you just like he asked!
    0x5FAE, // You caught on quick, Hisao.
    0x5FCA, // And if I refuse?
    0x5FDB, // I have no intention of refusing, of course.
    0x6007, // But I've got to at least put up a token resistance to such a masterfully executed plan.
    0x605F, // Well, if you refused I'd have to pout.
    0x6086, // And you'd have to live with being the guy who made Emi Ibarazaki pout.
    0x60CD, // You don't want that on your conscience, do you?
    0x60FD, // As if to demonstrate, Emi begins pouting.
    0x6127, // It is the most adorable, heart-wrenching thing I've ever seen.
    0x6166, // Okay! I'll do it!
    0x6178, // Just… don't do that!
    0x618F, // I feel like I just hit a puppy!
    0x61AF, // So it's settled, right?
    0x61C7, // You're going to be my running partner?
    0x61EE, // Follow the workout?
    0x6202, // And the dietary plan?
    0x6218, // Dietary plan?
    0x6226, // Yeah, the dietary plan!
    0x623E, // You've got to eat healthy if you're going to get in shape, you know!
    0x6283, // I examine the workout routine closely.
    0x62AA, // I don't see a dietary plan on here.
    0x62CE, // Oh right! I forgot to give that to you!
    0x62F6, // Another crumpled sheet of paper is produced and handed over.
    0x6333, // It's somewhat less detailed.
    0x6350, // I had the nurse help me come up with it.
    0x6379, // The amount of dedication that the nurse has to keeping me in good health is pretty overwhelming.
    0x63DA, // I don't know many school nurses who would get one of their students to spy on me, much less help come up with a dietary plan.
    0x6458, // Then again, I guess I'm not in a normal school.
    0x6488, // And maybe that's not such a bad thing.
    0x64AF, // Then again, this dietary plan seems to cut out just about everything that'll be offered at the festival tomorrow.
    0x6521, // Hmm.
    0x6526, // So when does our running start?
    0x6546, // After the festival.
    0x655A, // Right after? What if I've had something to eat there? I could get a stomach ache, you know.
    0x65B6, // I meant the day after the festival.
    0x65DA, // I knew that.
    0x65E7, // Wasn't there something we were supposed to be doing?
    0x661C, // Oh! I guess we should get that paint for Rin, huh?
    0x664F, // Oh no! It slipped my mind!
    0x666A, // By the time we get the paint and get back to the mural, Rin's already wandered off.
    0x66BE, // Oh well.
    0x66C7, // Emi and I both decide to part ways there, leaving the paint on the ground.
    0x6712, // Rin'll find it. Whenever she comes back, anyway.
    0x6743, // Festival's tomorrow. I'm actually a little excited for it.
    0x677E, // At the same time, the week's left me feeling pretty tired, so I read a little and then go to bed.
    0x67E0, // But why would Lilly leave her to her own devices? It seems to be quite out of the ordinary, going by Hanako's reaction.
    0x6858, // …Ah, that's right. I think Lilly mentioned something about going into town today before Rin bumped into us.
    0x68C6, // The thought of that walk makes me look outside.
    0x68F6, // The bright sun and occasional people wandering around and enjoying the afternoon make me yearn to get out of school, or at least do something other than sit here.
    0x6999, // Giving in to one of my worst vices, procrastination, I decide that history is a subject best studied on a Sunday. Or a Monday. Or on any day other than this one.
    0x6A3B, // I give a grunt as I lever myself out of my seat, briefly debating with myself whether or not to hang out with Kenji.
    0x6AB0, // He doesn't strike me as the 'enjoying the nice weather outside with others' kind of person, really. I guess I'll catch up with him later.
    0x6B3A, // Changing tacks, I briefly entertain the idea of talking with Hanako, but by the time I look at her seat, it's vacant. She must've left for the library.
    0x6BD2, // At five minutes past eight, an unbelievably loud banging jolts me awake. It's coming from outside my door.
    0x6C3D, // Quickly, I open the door to see Shizune and Misha standing side-by-side before me. Both of them look a little worn out, although it's more noticeable on Misha.
    0x6CDD, // Which one of you knocked?
    0x6CF7, // I ask, echoing the question that must be on the mind of everyone in the entire building.
    0x6D50, // Ahahaha, that's not important, Hicchan!
    0x6D78, // She quickly dismisses it without even batting an eye.
    0x6DAE, // Oh? You're still in your pajamas, Hicchan? So you don't wake up at eight?
    0x6DF8, // I notice her hair is wet. Her curls are barely holding their shape.
    0x6E3C, // No, I thought I'd sleep a bit later since it's the weekend and all, and I've been seriously sleep-deprived this week.
    0x6EB2, // I wonder if she missed the poison in my words.
    0x6EE1, // Then it's a good thing we came to wake you up!
    0x6F10, // Anyway, Hicchan, I guess you would like to know why we're here, wouldn't you?
    0x6F5E, // It's not hard to guess, but I wish she wouldn't say the words she is going to say next.
    0x6FB6, // Would you like to skip class and go somewhere nice with us?
    0x6FF2, // Come again?
    0x6FFE, // Would you like to skip class to do something fun?
    0x7030, // I was certain they'd force me to help them again with some slave work.
    0x7077, // Seriously?
    0x7082, // Misha grins and nods enthusiastically.
    0x70A9, // I like this new approach they're taking although I'm somewhat surprised that they would suggest skipping class, even if we have only half a day since it's Saturday.
    0x714E, // Aren't you two worried about constantly missing class?
    0x7185, // Well, it doesn't seem to be a problem! Hicchan, this school is pretty much at a standstill whenever this time rolls around.
    0x7201, // It's a Saturday, too~. Don't you want to do something fun?
    0x723C, // I'm amazed by how little they seem to care.
    0x7268, // Not that we're pressuring you to give us your company, but we thought you might like to hang out!
    0x72CA, // So… would you like to join us? Come on, you'll have a lot more fun than just sitting here with your head on your desk~!
    0x7344, // I guess I won't be missing anything important; nor will I be missed.
    0x7389, // All right, then, I don't think I'd be missing much. What do you have in mind?
    0x73D7, // My eyes narrow with suspicion as a thought crosses into my mind.
    0x7418, // Wait… this isn't just some trick to get me to do some more student council stuff, right?
    0x7473, // No, of course not!
    0x7486, // And that's a really mean thing to just assume like that, Hicchan.
    0x74C8, // …And besides, you're in the Student Council now, remember?
    0x7505, // If we wanted you to do something for us, we wouldn't have to trick you~!
    0x754E, // Hahaha!
    0x7556, // This is a kind of coercion that is new to me. Only two pretty girls could pull it off.
    0x75AD, // I allow myself to relax a bit. Maybe I'm being too paranoid; it seems like they may really just want to hang out.
    0x761F, // Nevertheless…
    0x762F, // No tricks?
    0x763A, // No tricks! Stop being so paranoid!
    0x765D, // Well, if you say so.
    0x7672, // Suddenly, I realize I still am wearing pajamas.
    0x76A2, // I wonder if you'd let me dress up first?
    0x76CB, // Eh? Why, Hicchan? You look just fine!
    0x76F1, // I'd still prefer wearing something else.
    0x771A, // I close the door before she gets a chance to reply and quickly pull on my uniform.
    0x776D, // Stepping back into the hallway, I see Shizune and Misha are engaged in an animated discussion.
    0x77CC, // I wonder if people discussing in sign ever accidentally poke each other in the eyes.
    0x7821, // While I'm contemplating this, Shizune taps me on the shoulder impatiently.
    0x786C, // So, we're planning on slipping into town! Remember that tea shop we were at on Wednesday?
    0x78C6, // Tea shop?
    0x78D0, // You don't remember?
    0x78E4, // Oh, you mean that café.
    0x78FD, // Tea shop! It's called the Shanghai. China is the birthplace of tea, you know. Come on, Hicchan! I'll even treat you today!
    0x7978, // Ah… not me, not me, I mean Shicchan! Ahaha~!
    0x79A7, // I don't know…
    0x79B7, // It's nice, it's really relaxing! It's like… half café, half restaurant, half sophisticated, half… library…
    0x7A29, // What?
    0x7A2F, // That's a lot of halves.
    0x7A47, // But Misha doesn't seem to notice that.
    0x7A6E, // So~! Come on, it's not often that we have this much free time!
    0x7AAD, // If you're busy, though, you don't have to! It's not like your presence is absolutely, absolutely required!
    0x7B18, // Hahahaha!
    0x7B22, // I've never seen more weakly disguised reverse psychology in my life. I feel kind of tired today, and my teachers in my classes might want to know where I am. Maybe.
    0x7BC7, // On the other hand, I haven't really been into town at all since I've gotten here, so this is a good reason to head there.
    0x7C41, // Also, I could use something to eat. If it's Shizune's treat, even better; I'm totally broke.
    0x7C9E, // All right, let's go. Lead the way.
    0x7CC1, // Great~!
    0x7CC9, // We make it to the tea shop with a fifteen-minute walk. It seems that we are the only customers around.
    0x7D30, // Is it always this quiet in the morning?
    0x7D58, // By that, I mean is it always this empty.
    0x7D81, // No, this is kind of weird. Hey, this isn't a bad thing though, right?
    0x7DC7, // You're right.
    0x7DD5, // We take our seats at a large, square wooden table, and it hits me that I don't know what this place serves. I just went with what Yuuko recommended the last time.
    0x7E78, // Hey, is there a menu or something?
    0x7E9B, // Nope!
    0x7EA1, // That was a strange amount of zest.
    0x7EC4, // So, Hicchan, have you decided what you're going to order?
    0x7EFE, // I look around the store and can't see anything resembling a menu.
    0x7F40, // I don't understand, what's up with this place? What gives?
    0x7F7B, // Is this some kind of secret shop? Can you normally only enter here with a secret handshake? Some kind of wink and a nod?
    0x7FF4, // Do you need someone to vouch for you? A blood oath? Dammit, it was nothing like this last time.
    0x8054, // I don't know, the last time I think I just got coffee? What do they serve here?
    0x80A4, // Tea!
    0x80A9, // Ah, well, that's…
    0x80BD, // Not just tea, right? Not only tea? There's other stuff too, right?
    0x8100, // Clearly~!
    0x810A, // Clearly? Like what? There are no menus here. Where are the menus?
    0x814C, // They're playing another joke on me. There is no way out of this; all I can do is brace myself for the inevitable, oncoming burn.
    0x81CD, // I almost want to walk out of the store, but I'm already sitting down.
    0x8213, // It would be improper to leave now; the unspoken rules of polite social conduct block my exit like a wall of fire.
    0x8285, // I decide to play it safe. I'll order what they order, if it's acceptably manly enough.
    0x82DC, // Why don't you two order before me? Ladies first.
    0x830D, // Well played, Hicchan, but~ we already ordered!
    0x833C, // How is that possible? When? How? From who?
    0x8367, // We're regulars, we come here so often that we don't have to do that any more!
    0x83B5, // Well, I guess you've had enough. We're sitting on the menus, of course~!
    0x83FE, // I look around at the other tables. There are no menus on any of them. That means they must just keep them in a big stack near the door or something. What a thing to sit on, and what speed to grab them so quickly.
    0x84D3, // Well, whatever. Can I have one, then?
    0x84F9, // You can take one if you want, but you're not the kind of person who would do something that la—sci—vious?, isn't that right?
    0x857A, // I tell them that I'd just like some coffee and put my head down on the cool tabletop.
    0x85D0, // Coffee? This is a very high class establishment, and you're going to order coffee?
    0x8623, // I can tell they're messing with me again.
    0x864D, // In that case, I'll have whatever you're having.
    0x867D, // Hicchan, Shicchan is drinking a special tea that is only grown in remote areas of India.
    0x86D6, // The tea is still handmade by a tribe of tea makers who have passed the methods down in their families for generations.
    0x874D, // They must wade through alligator-infested waters to obtain the leaves once a year. On each trip, some do not make it back alive.
    0x87CE, // I can't drink that, I would feel too guilty.
    0x87FB, // Then I'll have what you're having.
    0x881E, // I don't know what I'm drinking.
    0x883E, // How?
    0x8843, // Fine, then I want the tea that people died for.
    0x8873, // No, never mind. I'll have coffee.
    0x8895, // If this is a very high class establishment, then they should have very high class coffee, right? …No one died for it, right?
    0x8914, // The perfect answer, there is no way they can stand against it. Shizune shrugs, as if to say 'well played.'
    0x897F, // They still didn't answer my second question.
    0x89AC, // Misha calls for Yuuko, who brings over our drinks and a single incredibly tiny yellow cake with a little black plastic fork stuck in it for each of us.
    0x8A44, // I eat my cake in one bite, amazed at how it's probably the least filling thing I've ever eaten.
    0x8AA4, // Hicchan, do you have any plans for tomorrow?
    0x8AD1, // Misha takes a gulp of her tea, something sounding suspiciously high class even though it looks like ordinary tea.
    0x8B43, // She drinks with incredible recklessness considering how hot it is. The exact opposite of Shizune or Lilly.
    0x8BAE, // Plans? That sounds ominous.
    0x8BCA, // Plans? Yes.
    0x8BD6, // Yes, I am incredibly busy tomorrow. In fact, I have so much to do that I will not have any free time at all.
    0x8C43, // That's right… none whatsoever. And everything I have to do is extremely important. Very, very important.
    0x8CAE, // Misha giggles, clearly not buying it, and then signs it all back to Shizune, who nods slowly and deliberately while looking very unamused.
    0x8D39, // Suddenly, she leans forward, staring analytically at my face like a human lie detector, waiting for the smallest tell to give me away.
    0x8DC0, // After at least a minute of this, she sits back down in her seat and takes a sip of tea.
    0x8E18, // Okay, Hicchan, if you're that busy. We don't have anything to do tomorrow, so we thought maybe you would want to hang out with us at the festival!
    0x8EAB, // You're new here, anyway, right? Right? So~ we thought we would show you around and have some fun together, but if you're that busy, we understand!
    0x8F3E, // Oh well, oh well!
    0x8F50, // The both of them shrug together in perfect sync, as if they've rehearsed it.
    0x8F9D, // Ahahahahaha~!
    0x8FAB, // Hicchan, you're so paranoid.
    0x8FC8, // …And you'll never beat me anyway, so why bother getting so worked up about it?
    0x9019, // Haha! Wow, Shicchan~!
    0x902F, // Beat you? What are you talking about?
    0x9055, // Is she talking about the coercion? I never realized that was just a game to her. I thought I was the only one who saw it as competition.
    0x90DE, // You know~! …Eh? Do you, Hicchan? Because I don't.
    0x9112, // You can't outwit me! —Ah, well, Hicchan, not me…
    0x9147, // What? What are you talking about, Shicchan…
    0x9175, // I can see Shizune smiling craftily, daring me to enter this battle of wills and wits with her.
    0x91D4, // When he is pushed to the edges of despair, a man has no choice but to sink, or grasp at the fleeting wisps of hope, fight with all his power against the inevitabilities of his fate and struggle against the impossible.
    0x92AE, // For even if he fails, at least fail knowing that he dared greatly…
    0x92F3, // …Or something like that.
    0x930E, // Well, we'll see about that. Don't underestimate me.
    0x9342, // Don't you have to follow through to make good on that, Hicchan?
    0x9382, // Ah, well, I could get lucky. Don't count out that possibility.
    0x93C1, // You won't~.
    0x93CD, // I will! Wait—
    0x93DD, // Let's make a wager on it, then!
    0x93FD, // I don't care about competition.
    0x941D, // That's a blatant lie.
    0x9433, // Wait, what exactly do you mean?
    0x9453, // That's okay if you don't know, neither do I! Wahahaha!
    0x948A, // So it's settled, then! All right, all right!
    0x94B7, // What? Didn't you hear what I just said?
    0x94DF, // Now all that's left is the stakes! What the winner wins, or, more interestingly, what the loser loses!
    0x9546, // Hey!
    0x954B, // This is a very dangerous game I'm playing. Shizune herself is a very dangerous girl, if she can only think in terms of winning and losing.
    0x95D6, // If she views every time that I talk with her as some kind of battle of wills, I don't think I could take it.
    0x9643, // That kind of thing drives people insane. She's too Machiavellian; before this I'd assumed she was just kind of stoic.
    0x96B9, // But nevertheless, I'm interested. In hindsight, I realize that I just challenged her to what is essentially a duel without any rules that won't end until one of us… what?
    0x9766, // I guess that's it. That's so vague. What are the conditions for winning or losing? The first person to feel stupid loses?
    0x97E0, // I don't know, I've never had to think of anything like this before.
    0x9824, // Never?
    0x982B, // Never.
    0x9832, // So you have never gambled, Hicchan?
    0x9856, // I'm surprised you two have.
    0x9872, // Oh, come on… It's just for fun, anyway! Between friends~!
    0x98AE, // It's about causing humiliation, suffering, and absolute despair! Isn't that the point?
    0x9905, // Shizune puts a finger to her temple thoughtfully.
    0x9937, // …!
    0x993C, // Hm… Ah, how about this, Hicchan: if you lose, you have to go to school one day without any pants on.
    0x99A3, // Are you insane?
    0x99B3, // Although in comparison to what I was afraid she would say, it's pretty mild.
    0x9A00, // Can't we just bet money, like normal people?
    0x9A2D, // It's not like you could match my wager if we did~! Now, it's your turn! …But nothing perverted! Understand?
    0x9A9B, // I think I need more time.
    0x9AB5, // This is going to have me constantly on edge for weeks.
    0x9AEC, // Okay~! Come on, you should both hurry up, your drinks are getting cold!
    0x9B34, // I quickly down the rest of my coffee as Shizune does the same, staring at me with a fierce look of competition in her eyes.
    0x9BB0, // It seems like a waste for her to be gulping down something that someone may have died for her to enjoy.
    0x9C18, // Hicchan, are you sure you don't want to hang out tomorrow? A lot of people are looking forward to it; you don't want to miss out.
    0x9C9A, // I mumble unintelligibly at her.
    0x9CBA, // I don't really understand…
    0x9CD7, // It's time to think. Shizune's drink is smaller, but I can consume mine faster.
    0x9D26, // If Shizune finishes her drink first, she might skip out on paying, leaving me to pick up the tab, even though she said the drinks were on her.
    0x9DB5, // Because I have no money on me, I would be humiliated, and therefore this could be considered a loss.
    0x9E1A, // If I finish first, the laws of chivalry would make me look like a jerk, as I would need to run out of this teahouse, leaving her to pay for everything. That could also be considered a loss. She would use that.
    0x9EEC, // In the event of a draw, she may attempt to run out the door, and I'll probably do the same. This might lead to a collision at the door, which would be humiliating, but not overly so. …And Misha would be left to pick up the tab.
    0x9FD2, // This is really childish. I'm a little disappointed in Shizune, and myself.
    0xA01D, // Well, Hicchan, it'd be really nice if we could all celebrate how well we put everything together for the festival by taking a look at our handiwork…
    0xA0B4, // Misha seems oblivious to the fact that an epic battle of wills is raging in front of her. I nod slowly and down the last of my coffee.
    0xA13B, // Well, I am finished enjoying my drink. I guess it's time for me to leave. And I am going to leave now. Calmly.
    0xA1AA, // You too, Shicchan?
    0xA1BD, // Why are you two acting so weird?
    0xA1DE, // I quickly walk out the door and Shizune follows. Misha is going to have to foot the bill.
    0xA238, // Sorry, Misha.
    0xA246, // Catching up to me, Shizune quickly pushes her glasses up and presses a note into my hand.
    0xA2A0, // So you think you can win today? That's kind of cocky, Shizune.
    0xA2DF, // I forgot for a second that she can't hear me. I nod.
    0xA314, // Right now, she seems much cuter than she usually is, smiling softly with a hint of confidence coming through.
    0xA382, // Shizune looks energetic and carefree, although it could just be the caffeine.
    0xA3D0, // She winks, and extends her hand for a handshake. I wonder if there's a buzzer in there and she plans to shock me, but that doesn't seem like something she would do, so I accept.
    0xA482, // With a squeeze, she pushes another note into my hand. I momentarily think that it's a buzzer and wonder if the shock could kill me.
    0xA506, // Shizune smirks and then runs off.
    0xA528, // I crush the note in my fist dramatically, but no one is there to see it, and that makes me sad.
    0xA588, // I wonder if it's too late to go back to the shop and ask Misha for directions.
    0xA5D7, // But then again, I gave her a hard time for not knowing the way here, so I can't allow her to score off me for not knowing the way back.
    0xA65F, // And if I ask her, Shizune could see it as a victory. No, it's not necessary.
    0xA6AC, // The school is on top of a damn hill, how hard could it be to find?
    0xA6EF, // I may be slightly directionally challenged, but I'm sure that even I can do this.
    0xA741, // About an hour and a half later, I walk the long paved path leading from the gates to the main building.
    0xA7A9, // Hahaa! Just the person we were waiting for. So you made it here eventually, Hicchan, good! Now it's time for work work work~!
    0xA827, // Misha and Shizune had laid an ambush for me in the main lobby of the ground floor and I walked straight into it. I should have just circled around the school like I had originally planned, but I thought that I was overreacting and being silly.
    0xA91B, // Misha is waving a thick stack of printouts in my general direction, taunting me.
    0xA96C, // We sort of need your help~!
    0xA988, // Sort of?
    0xA991, // We need your help~!
    0xA9A5, // You will help us!
    0xA9B7, // Misha speaks with her usual playful, carefree manner, but even so I can hear Shizune's unnervingly hard severity behind it.
    0xAA33, // That sounds like an order.
    0xAA4E, // Really? Is it?
    0xAA5D, // Eh? It is?
    0xAA68, // Ah, sorry, Hicchan, I guess it is! Hahahaha!
    0xAA95, // She doesn't sound very sorry at all.
    0xAABA, // I thought we had almost everything done by now, but it turns out we have all these signs to attach to backing boards.
    0xAB30, // More hands make light work!
    0xAB4C, // And everybody wins! Hahahahaha!
    0xAB6C, // This is your duty, after all, as a member of the Student Council. Which you are a part of.
    0xABC7, // As a member.
    0xABD4, // Of the Student Council.
    0xABEC, // Ahahaha~!
    0xABF6, // It's a simple task, so getting it out of the way now would be good. It's not that much work. A small thing, really!
    0xAC6A, // And we'd really appreciate your help!
    0xAC90, // Really, really appreciate it!
    0xACAE, // Besides, it's time to pay back for us treating you so nicely!
    0xACEC, // So the tea shop was a trap after all! You two-timing scoundrels!
    0xAD2D, // Don't say that, it was completely unrelated. We wanted to celebrate you joining the council!
    0xAD8A, // But why did she bring that up, then?
    0xADAF, // But—{w=0.3}{nw}
    0xADC1, // No buts! You're coming with us!
    0xADE1, // I don't even get to finish my sentence as they grab me by the arms and try to pull me towards their office.
    0xAE4D, // Misha laughs giddily as she and Shizune exchange sly looks behind my back.
    0xAE98, // Ah, I don't think you have a choice in this, Hicchan! Hahahaha!
    0xAED8, // There are two of us, so don't even try to get away, now! Don't take us lightly!
    0xAF28, // Hicchan, it's your duty to help us, anyway! As a member of the Student Council!
    0xAF78, // All right, all right! How could I forget?
    0xAFA2, // But, seriously, aren't there other people who can help you?
    0xAFDE, // Like who, Hicchan?
    0xAFF1, // You were fine with helping us yesterday…
    0xB01C, // Yesterday is not today!
    0xB034, // And anyone who isn't me!
    0xB04D, // Why don't you have anyone else in the council?
    0xB07C, // That's what we'd like to know! …Aha… Ahahahahaha!
    0xB0B2, // Misha's laughter explodes through the hall. She doesn't notice the grimace on my face at all. That's right, it's just the two of them, isn't it?
    0xB143, // Oh, right. Okay, I'll help you.
    0xB163, // Misha runs her tongue over her teeth, looking quite pleased.
    0xB1A0, // That's my Hicchan! I knew we could trust you~!
    0xB1CF, // So predictable~.
    0xB1E0, // When we get to the student council room, my jaw drops. The number of signs, backing boards, and signposts is insane.
    0xB255, // They're stacked all over the place like building materials at a construction site, something I let Shizune and Misha know right off the bat.
    0xB2E2, // There are so many signposts here you could probably build a second wall around the school with them!
    0xB347, // Hahaha~! Really? Well, there are a lot of them, so maybe…
    0xB383, // Eh? No?
    0xB38B, // How do you know that, Shicchan?
    0xB3AB, // Really?
    0xB3B3, // Don't tell me she's actually considered it?!
    0xB3E0, // Shizune hesitates, then pushes her glasses up a bit as Misha lets out a very uneasy sounding laugh.
    0xB444, // So she has considered it.
    0xB45E, // Ahaha! That's… irrelevant, Hicchan! Can you get on with making the signs, please?
    0xB4B2, // All right, all right.
    0xB4C8, // I feel sort of lied to, though. I thought you said it wouldn't be that much work?
    0xB51A, // Ah, well, Shicchan meant it wouldn't be that much work for us.
    0xB559, // Someone has to supervise you while you do this, you know, to make sure you're doing it right. And those people will be us.
    0xB5D4, // So what are you two going to do?
    0xB5F5, // Watch you! Hahahaha~!
    0xB60B, // No, that was just a joke, Hicchan. We'll help out too, of course. The Student Council is really supposed to have a lot more people.
    0xB68F, // This is just a bad year. Fewer people than usual, even though we already didn't have many the year before.
    0xB6FA, // And then there's just a lot more work than before, too.
    0xB732, // Besides, Shicchan likes working with you. And so do I!
    0xB769, // We've accomplished a lot more than we normally could, you know.
    0xB7A9, // I can accept that. Lately, they've been looking a little fatigued every time I see them.
    0xB802, // Student council work is apparently a 24-hour-a-day thing, and from what I've seen and heard, there are just the two of them. Well, I guess I make it three.
    0xB89E, // They must work almost nonstop. I wonder how much time they spend working in this room, when I don't see them.
    0xB90C, // And I've even glimpsed Misha taking naps sometimes without Shizune at her side. By herself, Shizune has to be working 60-hour weeks doing her student council duties, on top of regular classes.
    0xB9CD, // Two hours pass, and I reach for a tack only to find the box is empty. Shizune grabs it before I can even say anything.
    0xBA44, // She smiles, tossing it expertly into a trash can along with another empty box of tacks.
    0xBA9C, // So you're out too, Hicchan? Don't worry, Shicchan says she'll get some more.
    0xBAE9, // We went through a box too, but me and Shicchan decided to wait until you needed a new box as well before getting a new one.
    0xBB65, // Something about that strikes me as odd.
    0xBB8D, // Wait, we both ran out of tacks just now? Wow, what a weird coincidence, huh?
    0xBBDA, // Ah, well, actually, Hicchan, we ran out twenty minutes ago, and there was only one spare box of tacks, the ones we gave to you.
    0xBC5A, // And you were flying through those pretty quickly, so~! we thought that we should wait until we both had no more tacks before getting more!
    0xBCE5, // Then, Shicchan could go get fresh boxes of tacks for all of us at the same time. You know, for efficiency~!
    0xBD51, // Shizune nods, preparing to step out the door.
    0xBD7F, // Wait a second, so what did you two do for the past 20 minutes?
    0xBDBE, // Ahaha~! Nothing, of course! What could we do? We had no tacks, Hicchan!
    0xBE06, // Shizune and Misha exchange knowing glances before they give me a perfectly synchronized and incredibly exaggerated simultaneous shrug.
    0xBE8D, // I see. So you decided to take a break. Clever.
    0xBEBC, // Oh, we know it was clever.
    0xBED7, // Whose idea was it?
    0xBEEA, // The both of us, of course, of course!
    0xBF10, // Ahahaha~! Well, Hicchan, it was all Shicchan's idea.
    0xBF45, // I turn immediately to Shizune, who gives me a curt wave and a surprisingly cheery smile before quickly vanishing out the door.
    0xBFC4, // Well then why didn't you just say you wanted to take a break!?
    0xC003, // I used to think that Shizune and Misha were polar opposites. Misha always seems so energetic and playful, like any other girl. Shizune, on the other hand, always seemed distant. Aggressively manipulative and vaguely scary, but distant.
    0xC0EF, // There were times when I thought that she had no sense of humor. As cute as she was, I'd almost never seen her smile. Not to mention all the other things.
    0xC189, // The analytical stare, the permanently stoic expression, and even her penmanship; so mechanically precise that everything she writes looks typed.
    0xC21A, // But Shizune and Misha really aren't as different as I'd thought.
    0xC25B, // I'm a little surprised.
    0xC273, // Why?
    0xC278, // Shizune. I didn't know that she liked to joke around like that.
    0xC2B8, // What I mean to say is, I didn't know that she could act so girlish. It was actually pretty cute.
    0xC319, // You would be surprised, Hicchan.
    0xC33A, // Well, I didn't know you and her were so close, either, the first time I saw you.
    0xC38B, // I've always been curious as to how these two met.
    0xC3BD, // Do you two go far back or something?
    0xC3E2, // Childhood friends?
    0xC3F5, // Next-door neighbors?
    0xC40A, // Haha… Sorry, Hicchan, it's not anything like that, even if it would be cuter that way.
    0xC463, // When I came to this school, they just placed me next to Shicchan, and she looked like a very serious person.
    0xC4D0, // And I thought, 'I'm going to be spending the rest of the year next to this person, maybe!'
    0xC52B, // 'So it would be nice if we could be friends! But~, I wonder if she'll like me.'
    0xC57B, // And I learned that she was deaf. You know, Hicchan, the first time I just thought she was ignoring me~!
    0xC5E3, // But, luckily, I knew a little sign language, and we became friends.
    0xC627, // I want to know where Misha learned how to sign, but I guess that's something for another time.
    0xC686, // Now, I guess we're always together. It's nice, I've always wanted someone to listen to me, and I think Shicchan likes having someone to talk to! So, everybody wins.
    0xC72B, // Heh. That's nice.
    0xC73D, // That's it? You look disappointed, Hicchan, what were you expecting?
    0xC781, // Ahahahahaha!
    0xC78E, // You know, Hicchan, I don't think that me and Shicchan thanked you properly.
    0xC7DA, // For what?
    0xC7E4, // Joining the Student Council. You've been a real help to us, Hicchan! I think I will get a lot more sleep now~!
    0xC853, // Well, I'm glad I could help, if it helps a young woman sleep at night.
    0xC89A, // That's an interesting thing to say, Hicchan.
    0xC8C7, // Shicchan really appreciates you helping us out too.
    0xC8FB, // At that moment, Shizune steps back into the room, looking slightly annoyed and sipping offhandedly from a juicebox.
    0xC96F, // She throws two boxes of tacks on the floor with a wry smile.
    0xC9AC, // Ah, Shicchan.
    0xC9BA, // Misha opens her mouth to speak, but then quickly closes it as Shizune suddenly crumples her juicebox with a crunch like the sound of breaking bones.
    0xCA4F, // I can tell that each harsh, quaking hand gesture is most likely an epithet.
    0xCA9B, // What's she saying?
    0xCAAE, // It was just very hard to get these…
    0xCAD4, // I guess that is an understatement, Shicchan…
    0xCB03, // Shizune calms down a bit, straightening her glasses and lightly brushing her bangs back with one finger.
    0xCB6C, // It really wasn't a big deal in retrospect? That's forward thinking of you!
    0xCBB7, // All right then, I guess the two of us should get back to work, Hicchan!
    0xCBFF, // Sure, why not.
    0xCC0E, // By the time we're done with the signs, it's already getting dark out.
    0xCC54, // I hadn't expected something like this to take so long. But then again, if it were that easy, I doubt Shizune and Misha would have asked for my help.
    0xCCE9, // Shizune falls into a nearby chair, cracking her knuckles systematically and letting out a muted yawn.
    0xCD4F, // That's all for today, I guess! That's a good thing, Shicchan, I'm very tired, too.
    0xCDA2, // That took longer than expected.
    0xCDC2, // You agree? Hahaha, we didn't expect it to take so long either! Not as planned!
    0xCE11, // Aww, I'm so hungry. I just realized I haven't eaten all day.
    0xCE4E, // Now that I think about it, I have eaten nothing since I woke up this morning, but right now I'm almost too tired to think about food.
    0xCED4, // I think they already stopped serving dinner.
    0xCF01, // This can't be happening! Hicchan, can you think of any way we could… obtain food?
    0xCF55, // Obtain food?
    0xCF62, // I don't like her tone of voice.
    0xCF82, // Why not order out? Oh, that's right, I guess I could do that.
    0xCFC0, // Order out? From where?
    0xCFD7, // From town, of course!
    0xCFED, // I didn't know they deliver to the school. Well, what are you going to get?
    0xD038, // Maybe some Chinese food!
    0xD051, // As long as you're going to, can I get in on it too? I'm also pretty hungry.
    0xD09D, // Ahahaha~! Hicchan, you should have just said so in the first place!
    0xD0E1, // What's that? It's your treat? That's great! That's great!
    0xD11B, // Wahaha, that's true, if it wasn't for you, we wouldn't be here so late, Shicchan!
    0xD16D, // Misha quickly grabs a menu from a drawer behind her and begins to enter the number slowly and carefully, as if she's used to messing it up.
    0xD1F9, // What do you want, Hicchan?
    0xD214, // Well, I guess I'll just have some dumplings.
    0xD241, // I raise my hand in a gesture of thanks to Shizune, who responds with a very faint, split-second smile.
    0xD2A8, // Ahahahahaha~!! Hicchan, Shicchan is paying for everything tonight, it's all on her, so you can afford to splurge a little!
    0xD323, // Some shrimp fried rice too, then.
    0xD345, // All right, all right! And you, Shicchan?
    0xD36E, // A Chinese omelette? Okay, then.
    0xD38E, // Hey, Misha, does that really mean 'omelette'? Can I see that again?
    0xD3D2, // Sure! Haha! Like this, like this…
    0xD3F6, // And this is for what you ordered: Dumplings!
    0xD423, // Shrimp fried rice!
    0xD436, // I'm going to get soup and a stir-fry, you say that like this…
    0xD476, // And here's how much it all costs: 3685 yen!
    0xD4A2, // Wahahahaha~!
    0xD4AF, // Well, I don't know in how many situations I'll need to remember such an exact number…
    0xD507, // Ahahahaha! Okay~! I'm going to order now, unless anyone wants something else. No objections? All right all right, then!
    0xD57F, // Shizune impatiently twirls a pair of chopsticks between her fingers as we wait for the food to arrive.
    0xD5E6, // Hey, where did you get those?
    0xD604, // This isn't the first time we've ordered out, Hicchan, and they always give us a ton of chopsticks, for some reason, even when we tell them we're only two people.
    0xD6A6, // And you two have accumulated a lot of them from a lot of long nights eating takeout in the office?
    0xD709, // That's exactly it! Hahahahahaha!
    0xD72A, // I'm overstating it?
    0xD73E, // Haha! That's right, Shicchan! Hey, Hicchan, did you know that once we've collected a hundred pairs of chopsticks from ordering out, we'll be able to take over the universe?
    0xD7EB, // I used to think that too, when I was little.
    0xD818, // Hicchan, are you good at breaking them down the middle? I can never do it right, so I found the little pile of chopsticks Shicchan had saved up and practiced on at least twenty of them.
    0xD8D2, // She was really mad about that!
    0xD8F1, // I let out a laugh as Shizune turns bright red with indignation. I didn't know she had such a childish side.
    0xD95D, // When the food arrives, I dig in heartily, drinking one of the tiny cans of soda Shizune bought for us from one of the vending machines in the hall.
    0xD9F1, // Thanking them both for the food, I head back to the dorms, ready to turn in for the night.
    0xDA4C, // The dorms are eerily quiet except for the sounds of portable TVs and radios murmuring unintelligibly behind thin walls.
    0xDAC4, // It's quiet here at night, and very peaceful. I can hear the crickets chirping outside my window, and see actual stars when I look up.
    0xDB4A, // Tired, I try to fall asleep as quickly as I can, only feeling slightly robbed of my Saturday.
    0xDBA8, // The library seems as good a place as any to go. Hanako looked as if she was taken pretty off-guard by Lilly leaving, so she might want someone to talk to.
    0xDC43, // Slinging my bag over my shoulder, I make my way out of the classroom.
    0xDC89, // I walk down the hallway to the library, past a multitude of closed doors.
    0xDCD3, // Through each one the sound of furious rehearsal can be heard. Rock music blares out of one door, almost as loud as a concert.
    0xDD51, // I guess that's one of the advantages of a private school; there are actually enough rooms to go around at a time like this.
    0xDDCD, // And, when I think about it, the grounds and buildings of the school are kept in pretty good condition. That can't be too cheap.
    0xDE4D, // I've heard that this place has some pretty serious benefactors.
    0xDE8D, // The walls of the library only partially insulate the noise of the festival preparations, but they're the only sounds to be heard.
    0xDF0F, // Not a soul stirs here, with everyone apparently enjoying the weather outside or working on festival events.
    0xDF7B, // Yuuko isn't here either. Maybe she doesn't work on Saturdays.
    0xDFB9, // I quietly walk through the library, now fairly familiar with its layout. I head to the back, where Hanako's private little corner is.
    0xE03F, // I run my hand along the spines of the books on the way through, feeling the individual texture of each as I glance across the titles.
    0xE0C5, // I used to do this all the time at the library at the hospital. Some things never change, I guess.
    0xE127, // Like the smell of a library. No matter how much care you take, the paper in books is always going to degrade with time.
    0xE19F, // Probably, no matter which library you go into, anywhere in the world, it must have that same, musty smell.
    0xE20A, // I find something that looks light enough to read without any major thought involved then look for Hanako in the reading area.
    0xE288, // Once again, she is sitting on a beanbag with her back to a bookshelf. Reading the same book she'd had in the classroom, she's slowly making her way through the pages.
    0xE32F, // Unlike last time I saw her here, I quietly take a seat in a beanbag. The noise is enough to catch her attention, but not startle her.
    0xE3B5, // This delicate routine that must be followed each and every time I try to talk to her almost feels like hunting game.
    0xE42A, // Is that the same book as before?
    0xE44B, // Y-yes… I'm almost finished…
    0xE46B, // Cool.
    0xE471, // I wonder if I should…
    0xE489, // Do you mind if I borrow it when you're finished?
    0xE4BA, // My mouth is faster than my mind, it seems.
    0xE4E5, // S-sure… you m-may not like it but…
    0xE50C, // I'm sure it can't be that bad. After all, you've stuck with it, haven't you?
    0xE559, // I-I guess.
    0xE564, // I settle into my beanbag and set about reading my own book that had been buried in my bag.
    0xE5BF, // It's a light novel about pirates. To be honest I'm barely skimming over the words, having chosen the book merely because it belongs to a different genre than I usually read.
    0xE66D, // Finding it hard to muster enough enthusiasm to finish the book, and noting that I've inadvertently distracted Hanako quite a bit, I decide to try and make conversation.
    0xE716, // So, I see Lilly left without you?
    0xE738, // She nods before taking her eyes off her book. She must have been really into it after all.
    0xE793, // Lilly said she had to go and… meet someone…
    0xE7C3, // Oh?
    0xE7C7, // A-Akira. Her sister…
    0xE7DE, // Sister? I haven't heard her talk about her family…
    0xE813, // She… she and Akira used to live together.
    0xE83F, // I thought all the students lived in the dorms?
    0xE86E, // T-they… I mean we… don't have to.
    0xE894, // But it's easier, right? I mean, there's food here and you're close to school… I don't think I've ever been to class on time so often in my life.
    0xE927, // Her badly hidden smile proves quite rewarding.
    0xE956, // In the back of my mind I know I have a bit of homework to catch up on, but it's quite comfortable in here. No one can find me and force me into working for their pet project, either.
    0xEA0D, // Though now that I'm thinking about the festival, another question comes up…
    0xEA5B, // Hey, Hanako, what are you doing for the festival?
    0xEA8D, // For a split second I think that Hanako is about to throw her book in the air from shock.
    0xEAE6, // S-sorry…?
    0xEAF2, // I was just asking what you're doing for the festival tomorrow. Anything planned?
    0xEB43, // I… I don't know.
    0xEB56, // Hanako answers in the way that people do when they don't want you to ask any more questions. I take it large crowds and loud music aren't really her 'thing.'
    0xEBF4, // Oh, okay.
    0xEBFE, // Change the subject, change the subject…
    0xEC28, // So, what's Lilly's sister like?
    0xEC48, // She… she's nice. She's pretty like Lilly, but she dresses… business-like…
    0xEC98, // Business-like?
    0xECA7, // She… she's always wearing a suit…
    0xECCD, // Ah, I see. And that makes her less pretty somehow?
    0xED00, // Hanako gives an embarrassed shake of her head.
    0xED2F, // N-no… just… different.
    0xED4A, // I'll admit it, this has got me intrigued. To hear Hanako talk about someone other than Lilly is a first, and to be complimentary about it too…
    0xEDDB, // But as I try to picture this mystery sister, all I can think of is Lilly in a suit. And I can't imagine that not being attractive. Not at all.
    0xEE6A, // Well, one day you'll have to introduce me to her.
    0xEE9C, // O-okay.
    0xEEA4, // Our brief conversation ends as abruptly as it started, and we both return to our novels.
    0xEEFD, // The passage of time is marked only by the gradual movement of the patch of light cast through the window.
    0xEF67, // Slowly, the noises from the various rehearsals in the building fade out and die as students start to get hungry and tired.
    0xEFE2, // Just thinking about that makes my stomach start to turn knots around itself. I think it's time to head back.
    0xF04F, // Do you think Lilly would be back by now? I think I might head back to my dorm. I'm pretty tired from this week.
    0xF0BF, // And not a word of that is a lie. Moving to a new school as it ramps up for a major event has been taxing, to say the least.
    0xF13B, // I can feel myself nodding off as I read my book.
    0xF16C, // O-okay. I… I might stay here a little longer.
    0xF19C, // Looking at Hanako's book, I can see that she is only a few pages away from completing it.
    0xF1F6, // For a moment I consider hanging around until she finishes, but once again my stomach turns, emitting a gurgling sound.
    0xF26D, // Sure thing. Well I'm going to head off before it gets dark. I'll see you around, okay?
    0xF2C4, // O-okay. See you, Hisao.
    0xF2DC, // Later.
    0xF2E3, // H-Hisao?
    0xF2EC, // T-thank you. F-for hanging out with me.
    0xF314, // I can see how hard it was for her to get that simple sentence out of her mouth. It leaves me hanging for a moment.
    0xF387, // So. There is someone in this school who is even lonelier than me. Maybe lonely is a wrong word, I haven't been lacking company for this first week, but I've still managed to feel somewhat alone and detached.
    0xF457, // Maybe lonely is a wrong word for Hanako too, she has Lilly after all, doesn't she?
    0xF4AA, // I realize I've been standing there far too long without answering, and pull off a flawless, not too exaggerated smile.
    0xF521, // You're welcome.
    0xF531, // Good night, Hanako.
    0xF545, // N-night.
    0xF54E, // I leave her to finish her book and head back to the dorms and the promise of food…
    0xF5A3, // I keep wondering that myself. The lack of anything better to do, probably.
    0xF5EE, // He lets out a hearty laugh, then checks his watch.
    0xF621, // I really must take my leave now. Tezuka, I'm pleased to see that this little project is going so well.
    0xF688, // I just stopped by to remind you to not run off by yourself, tomorrow. I've invited certain people to the festival for you, and I'm sure they'd like to meet you as well.
    0xF731, // Also, Monday's club meeting is off, since I'm going out of town. I guess you kids can do something among yourselves, if you want to.
    0xF7B6, // He leaves, turning around flamboyantly, then walking off as dramatically as it's possible to walk.
    0xF819, // What a weird teacher.
    0xF82F, // I'll be off, too. See you around, Rin.
    0xF856, // Holding up a hand, I turn to go up the stairs to the dorms.
    0xF892, // Maybe, if I can finish reading these books today, the entirety of tomorrow will be free for the festival.
    0xF8FC, // I guess I'm a little interested in the art club.
    0xF92D, // I blurt it out, partially inadvertently.
    0xF956, // What do you mean?
    0xF968, // Nothing… specific.
    0xF97D, // I wonder if I could come by sometime. Even if it's just to observe or something.
    0xF9CE, // I've been thinking that I should join some club or something, so…
    0xFA12, // It's in no way a premeditated move, but a vague sense of determination has really been building inside of me for this past week.
    0xFA93, // I want to do something. I want to belong somewhere.
    0xFAC7, // It might as well be the art club, my shortcomings notwithstanding.
    0xFB0A, // The teacher seems pleased.
    0xFB25, // Oh? You want to join? Well, we always welcome new people, of course.
    0xFB6A, // Club meetings are normal enough. We study various aspects of the fine arts and try our hands at them, as well.
    0xFBD9, // Or feet.
    0xFBE2, // He gives an embarrassed cough, but Rin doesn't seem to mind. I take a small amount of comfort from the fact that I'm not the only one with vocabulary difficulties in this school.
    0xFC95, // Nomiya rebounds from his faux pas by theatrically checking the time from his huge, gleaming pocket watch, and slaps his forehead even more theatrically.
    0xFD2E, // I really must take my leave now, but if you have questions, I'm sure Tezuka can clarify.
    0xFD87, // Somehow, mentioning 'clarify' and Rin in the same sentence doesn't feel right. However, I don't say as much to the teacher, since he seems to be in a hurry.
    0xFE24, // Tezuka, I'm pleased to see that this little project is going so well.
    0xFE6A, // I hope I'll see you on Monday, then, Nakai.
    0xFE96, // The teacher leaves, and we are left by ourselves again. Rin is still painting as if nothing notable happened. Since nothing in fact did, I am left wondering what on Earth is wrong with me.
    0xFF53, // Art and I haven't worked well together in the past, at least judging from the grades I used to have in middle school.
    0xFFC9, // Maybe a club will be different than an obligatory class. Who knows?
    0x1000D, // I try to come up with something meaningful to ask about it, but to no avail.
    0x1005A, // I'll just go to a club meeting and see how it goes.
    0x1008E, // So he invited some people tomorrow just to check out your painting?
    0x100D2, // He has a lot of art-people friends. They like to talk about art.
    0x10113, // I think he wants me to talk about art with them.
    0x10144, // Somehow, I get the feeling that you aren't too thrilled about it.
    0x10186, // Rin shrugs noncommittally, but it still gives an impression of her general displeasure at the idea of having to discuss her painting, or any painting, with other people.
    0x10230, // I don't really like talking about art. It is already a way to talk without talking, so why bother talking about it?
    0x102A4, // I can understand that.
    0x102BB, // It's like being bored and talking about being bored, because you are bored.
    0x10307, // I'm not following you.
    0x1031E, // Have you ever talked about being bored? It's pointless and not very exciting. All you can really say about it is 'I'm so bored.' I once spent a week trying to think of something meaningful to say about boredness.
    0x103F3, // It was the most boring week I've ever had.
    0x1041E, // But that's pretty fitting, don't you think?
    0x1044A, // Rin gives me a look, the laconic kind that looks like it doesn't mean anything but it does.
    0x104A6, // Anyway… I don't know, I guess I just rarely can come up with anything to say about art.
    0x10500, // I mean, like this one you're doing now. I have no idea what to think about it, except that it looks nice. What is this painting about?
    0x10587, // It's not about anything at all.
    0x105A7, // That's what I'd like to say. So I did.
    0x105CE, // But that was a small lie. I said it anyway because I would kind of like it to be true.
    0x10625, // Teacher wanted me to do this, but I didn't have any ideas. I tried to have some, but nothing happened.
    0x1068C, // So now this is a painting without any ideas.
    0x106B9, // But… what are you painting then?
    0x106DC, // No idea.
    0x106E5, // Come to think of it, I think I'll call this 'No idea.'
    0x1071C, // Ah, now I started thinking again. This is bad.
    0x1074B, // She shakes her head vigorously for a while, trying to shake 'thinking' out of her head. That amber-red hair flies wildly around.
    0x107CC, // This is why I had Emi help me. She makes it easy to not think about anything.
    0x1081A, // You know, how she just talks talks talks about nothing for hours. It's like her head is made of bubblegum foam bath jelly.
    0x10895, // You are kinda the same, but not really. It's very helpful if you stay here.
    0x108E1, // I am not sure if that's a compliment or not. It's probably neither; with Rin being the overtly neutral person she is.
    0x10957, // So is there anything specific you'd like me to do to make you not think?
    0x109A0, // Just be.
    0x109A9, // So without knowing what I should do, I just sit on an empty box to watch her continue with the painting, idly leafing the pages of the beer-drinking book.
    0x10A44, // Rin has a serene expression on her face, her dark green eyes hiding what she might think behind them. No wait, she's supposedly not thinking anything, right?
    0x10AE2, // She quietly hums to a tune, interrupting every now and then with polite requests for more paint or another kind of brush.
    0x10B5C, // Her concentration is admirable, even though she seems to be sleep-deprived and under pressure to finish the job.
    0x10BCD, // Inch by inch the painting gains more form, details being added on top of details, colors entwining with each other, filling the empty spaces, growing on top of each other.
    0x10C79, // I find myself thinking about inspiration and motivation to create art again.
    0x10CC6, // Where does one get ideas? They don't come out of nowhere, and I don't think there are muses that magically inject some inspiration in your head.
    0x10D57, // Ideas have an origin and a purpose.
    0x10D7B, // The more I think about it, the more I'm convinced that Rin is lying about her mural, or at least twisting the truth. Maybe she doesn't even realize it, herself.
    0x10E1C, // You can't do anything creative without having an idea of what you are going to create. That would go against the definition.
    0x10E99, // Every stroke must be decided to be drawn. Even if it's made at random, then that, too, is a conscious decision.
    0x10F09, // So her painting, even this one, must be based on having some deliberate goal or idea of what to paint.
    0x10F70, // If Rin's idea is to have no idea, as she said, does that count as having an idea?
    0x10FC2, // A logical paradox? That seems to be Rin's modus operandi for most normal interactions, so it wouldn't surprise me if she hadn't even noticed this herself.
    0x1105D, // I wonder if I should bring it up, but I'm not sure if I want to engage in an argument about logic with this girl.
    0x110CF, // One of us would probably end up short-circuiting fairly quickly, so I discard the thought.
    0x1112A, // Rin is squirming and shuffling restlessly.
    0x11155, // Even her usual blank visage breaks occasionally into pretty difficult looking expressions, the kind that one doesn't just come up with accidentally.
    0x111EA, // Everything all right?
    0x11200, // Yes. No.
    0x11209, // My back started hurting again.
    0x11228, // This painting is too big, after all, and it's hard to paint in this position.
    0x11276, // Want to take a break?
    0x1128C, // After I finish this part.
    0x112A6, // Of course, she doesn't take a break, and I don't bring it up again because that would be completely and utterly pointless.
    0x11321, // Rin continues her work and I stay with her: I like to watch her paint, and I'm going to be a member of the same club she's in, now.
    0x113A5, // When she declares the mural to be finished, it's already so dark that I have no idea how she can tell.
    0x1140C, // There is no celebration, no general sense of a job well done, just a tired and laconic 'I'm done' and then we both go to sleep.
    0x1148C, // I just kinda stuck with her, I think.
    0x114B2, // I'm interested in the art club.
    0x114D2, // Go for a walk into town.
    0x114EB, // Go to the library.
    0x114FE, // Yu… Yuuko?
    0x1150B, // Hi, I had no idea you worked here.
    0x1152E, // Ah, yes, um…
    0x1153D, // Welcome to the Shanghai! May I take your order?
    0x1156D, // I don't know… well, some coffee, please?
    0x11598, // Yes, certainly. I'll make it right away and bring it to you when it's done.
    0x115E4, // Uh, thanks.
    0x115F0, // Hi, Lilly.
    0x115FB, // …Hisao?
    0x11605, // Yeah. Nice to see you again.
    0x11622, // Know each other?
    0x11633, // I… guess.
    0x1163F, // Hmm… care to take a seat?
    0x1165B, // I suppose some introductions might be in order.
    0x1168B, // Hisao, this is Akira Satou, my older sister. Akira, this is Hisao Nakai, another Yamaku student.
    0x116EC, // So, how's school recently?
    0x11707, // Sounds like it's pretty busy for ya, then.
    0x11732, // At least I'm not cooking your meals after school any more.
    0x1176D, // Whoa, so cold. Weren't ya just cooking for yourself anyway? I only ever got leftovers.
    0x117C4, // That's not the point… are you managing to feed yourself, at least?
    0x11809, // I can cook without blowing myself up, you know.
    0x11839, // Mostly.
    0x11841, // That's…
    0x1184B, // Hahaha! It's fine, it's fine. I needed to learn sometime anyway.
    0x1188C, // Ah, Lilly?
    0x11897, // Well, I'd better be off. It was nice talking to ya, Lilly.
    0x118D2, // Akira, do you have to…?
    0x118EC, // Sorry, I need to get back to work. They'll be on my neck again if I don't make it back quickly.
    0x1194C, // Bye, Akira…
    0x1195A, // C'mon, don't look so down. I'll be around again soon. Seeyas.
    0x11998, // She seems nice.
    0x119A8, // We used to live together, but now that I live at school we hardly ever see each other.
    0x119FF, // You used to live together? Was it somewhere around here?
    0x11A38, // It was pretty far south, so the trip into Yamaku was fairly long.
    0x11A7A, // With her working hours getting longer and Yamaku being so far away, there was little choice in the end but to move into the dormitories.
    0x11B03, // I take it you're better rested, now?
    0x11B28, // Sorry?
    0x11B2F, // You sound less exhausted than you did when you first came in.
    0x11B6D, // Yeah. Ended up walking all over town, despite only planning on taking a short walk down here.
    0x11BCB, // You're leaving?
    0x11BDB, // Yeah. You going to head back as well? It's getting kind of late.
    0x11C1C, // Yuuko, could we have one more coffee please?
    0x11C49, // Okay, I'll bring it right away!
    0x11C69, // That's… not subtle.
    0x11C7F, // Wanting company, then?
    0x11C96, // Hmm… I'd say that it's more that I was wondering…
    0x11CCC, // Do you have any siblings?
    0x11CE6, // No, only child. To be honest, the idea of having someone that close makes me a bit envious.
    0x11D42, // Interesting…
    0x11D51, // It's just that others have said the same thing before.
    0x11D88, // It's a difficult subject to try and think about objectively, given that I've always had someone like that.
    0x11DF3, // I heard from the school's head nurse that you had an incident the other day.
    0x11E40, // Ah. So it's about that.
    0x11E58, // Well, kind of, but it's not anything to be worried about.
    0x11E92, // Yes, yes it is. Anything that can endanger your health is something to be worried about.
    0x11EEB, // We try our best here to prepare you for life here. Part of that involves knowing your limits, and how to work around them.
    0x11F66, // It would be remiss of me if I didn't speak up about this.
    0x11FA0, // All right, I get it. I'm sorry.
    0x11FC0, // Mutou closes his eyes in frustration, and I realize that this probably wasn't the best thing to say.
    0x12025, // Something tells me that you're not sorry. Pretend as much as you want, but this isn't a normal school.
    0x1208C, // A lot of people have put in a lot of time, effort, and money to make sure that you, and every other student here, can have the same level of education as your peers.
    0x12132, // For you to abuse that by throwing out advice, especially medical advice, is plain selfish.
    0x1218D, // I'm not quite sure if this is actually how he feels, or if it is some act that he's practiced many times to guilt-trip students into doing the 'right' thing. Either way, it's working.
    0x12245, // I understand. This is all new to me, and I apologize. I know my limits now, and I'll be sticking to them.
    0x122AF, // Mutou appears to lighten up a little, satisfied that his message has been received.
    0x12303, // So, tell me, how are things?
    0x12320, // Things?
    0x12328, // I expected Mutou to be a little vague, but this is pushing the limits.
    0x1236F, // You know. Things. You've had a week to settle in now, so how are things?
    0x123B8, // Er, fine I guess.
    0x123CA, // I see. And how is your… condition?
    0x123EF, // The pause before 'condition' seemed a little unnecessary.
    0x12429, // Haven't had any problems so far.
    0x1244A, // A brief shimmer of relief passes across Mutou's face.
    0x12480, // Good, that's good. The school nurse was a little concerned that you might have been pushing yourself a bit too hard.
    0x124F5, // He asked me to keep an eye on you when he couldn't.
    0x12529, // That makes sense…
    0x1253D, // I'd ask that you don't blow us off so freely. As much as we try to give you the level of education that you would get at a normal school, you have to realize that you have limits.
    0x125F1, // Our goal is to make sure that you know where those limits are, and how to maximize your potential within them. Do you follow me?
    0x12672, // I guess. I mean, I don't plan on doing anything stupid.
    0x126AA, // Well, that's a start, I guess.
